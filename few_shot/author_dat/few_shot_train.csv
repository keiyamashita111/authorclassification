the servant who responded admitted him without ceremony and allowed him to proceed to a room on the second floor where he knocked gently at the door the rustle q a woman s dress was instantly heard and a moment later he had entered and stood in the presence of a lady perhaps twenty one years of age who was attired in deep black i heard you on the steps even before you rang she said joy beaming from her pale face how glad i am that you are here he looked a little annoyed but gave the lady a slight embrace and touched his lips lightly to hers she could not see the expression of his features for she was blind but she felt with the instinctive knowledge of those thus deprived that he was not as happy as usual philip she said gently what is the matter come and sit by me on the sofa and tell me all troubles jl of i have none he answered forcing a laugh as he accompanied her to the place have i not told you often that trouble and i were never made acquainted with each other i wish you could say the same when you are with me it a seems as if i could was her earnest reply it is only when you are that the time slowly do you realize that you have been out of town four days took up the hand she placed in his and patted it four days i he repeated i did not think it was so long then he added more apparently to divert her attention than for any other reason play me something she sprang up brightly and took a from an adjacent table there was no sign in her movements of her great misfortune she placed her hand as confidently upon the instrument as if her sight was perfect the blind

the atmosphere of the room filling it with low sweet sounds was a thorough mistress of an accomplishment too rare among american ladies and found himself under the spell of the harmony before he was aware of it he lay back and watched the striking face that bent lovingly over the and the long slender fingers adorned with plain and mourning rings that plied the bow the loose sleeves which the lady wore revealed space of where the delicate white flesh speaking of with its of lace appealed to his sense oi refinement do you know what that is she asked pausing in her playing no he said with a slight start you had soothed me into such a deep reverie i did not notice when you ceased to play it is called love in italy philip when are you going to take me there he drew his hand across his forehead and said â oh sometime she came and sat by his side again upon the sofa it will be full of wonderful things â that sometime of yours i have always wanted to be in italy i can scent in imagination its air i can hear the glad notes of its song birds i can imagine the gliding through the water with the easy motion of i can feel the delicious breezes of the and the my cheek all these i have dreamed of and sometime â yes sometime â you and i will experience them together it was the last word in her that made shrug his shoulders though the movement was so slight as to be even to miss s quick senses you must not forget he said that were we together in italy we should be farther apart than we are here in new york i can visit you in this house and the plea of business answers for everything this is your home in italy we should be philip and acquaintances i am not enough older than you to pass as your guardian and it would take little to attract attention the female you a man of business be obliged to take along would deprive us of solitude even in the handy railway carriages she would not recognize your ingenious claim that you are still that little child who used to climb on my knee and ask for bon though you and i have never noticed the difference why i could not sit by you on a sofa like this anywhere in the length and breadth of s she bore a triumphant look as he finished â the look of one who feels herself competent to every difficulty leave that she smiled there are apartments that can be hired in every city of italy as well as here there are italian waiting maids who speak no english and understand no more than one wishes them to there are secluded in the interior among the where we can go has its mountains but none so high that resolution cannot

recital but could not be restrained you re right about that pig business he remarked you recall the incident in mother goose where a little pig found a fifty dollar note and purchased a hat and a very fine coat there are strange in history mr would have replied to this remark in the terms it deserved had he not been too much engaged at the moment in a particularly fine chop as it was he growled over the meat like a in bad humor are there no for excessive of fat in the region asked taking his advantage it seems to me i have read of them in the newspapers retorted the other having swallowed the food and it with a glass of ale there are a thousand and i have tried them all i have taken things by the gross i have paid money to every i could find for awhile i starved myself so nearly to death that i went to making my with bs will and every day i grew i don t know what i measure now and i don t care a few more or less doesn t count when one falls from a steamer in mr took occasion to say that there was no need for this extreme a little coin in the hand or a new diamond ring would still bring youth and beauty to his friend that s just it retorted it s the contrast that s killing me the only women who would at me to day are ones that wouldn t care if i was black as or big as george iv why i could show you a of letters written me by the finest women in this country when i was at my best they breathe but one thing love love love i lived on it it was the air that kept my lungs in motion and i thought to go back to it so easily ah mr commenced upon his fourth chop and emptied the last of the bottle into his glass well i m sorry for you said i think the times must have changed as well as yourself though now here s a young fellow with all the of face figure and address that you once had and he claims to be unable to make the acquaintance of a single interesting woman between bridge and the heavy eyes of mr rested upon the youthful face opposite to him under the scrutiny to which he was subjected in the way he bad he had never looked more handsome place this is evidently a jest of yours said turning to mr not in the least i assure you then i say he can do what he likes and i know it replied the stout man if i had his form i d have to ask the police to clear the way for me i have seen circulation in front of this very hotel b cause i was coming out to take my carriage if he won t look at them why of course the women can t do it all but it lies with him s eyes with a strange mixture of hope and fear he did not think he would care to be in such great demand as that but he dearly wished to break through the iron bars that enclosed him he glanced in a glass that the wall near by he was good looking enough it was no vanity to say so what he lacked was confidence he is afraid of them that s his trouble smiled we cure him of that and when he gets to know women as they are he will give us a novel that will set all creation by the ears you know says he writes the purest english all he needs is a taste of life to this mr gave his assent and he added that it he could be of any service in the matter he would only be too glad we thank you for the offer and may be able later to make use of it said mr and now good morning for we have important business to attend to looked long and earnestly at the person they were leaving he seemed to him a very studying miss ordinary individual if such a man had won the love of scores of beautiful women surely he himself could gain the affections of one when he stood with in front of the hotel by which an procession of ladies and gentleman was already beginning to pass though it was only eleven o clock he felt much encouraged they are looking at you whispered plenty of them did you see those two girls in pink in that why they nearly broke their necks to get the last glimpse of you there lady who would stop if you asked her pretty as any of them though she must be nearly thirty your eyes are not open ah here is something better in that carriage with the it was miss and she bowed to mr then her bright eyes lit up with a new lustre as they fell upon his companion chapter v studying miss when mr made his appearance at the residence of mr the door was opened for him by a young negro of such superb proportions that the could not help observing him with admiration he thought he had never seen a man more perfectly formed the face though too dark to suggest black the least of blood was well the lips were not thick nor was the nose flat as is the case with so many of the african race the voice as the visitor heard it was by no means unpleasant mr could not imagine a better model for an statue than this butler or footman or whatever position perhaps both he might be engaged to fill yes sir miss is in and she is expecting ,1
you on the deck i pretended that you my identity you may guess i was not anxious to meet any person who knew me a moment s reflection taught me that it was foolish to carry out the and i went to you frankly and admitted the deception you know very well that i continued to pose as the husband of that lady during the voyage and that we went ashore together now i want to ask this question would that fact in itself make my friendship a thing you would desire to end the clock in the office loudly while mr was forming his reply in itself no he said at last i do not pretend to the morals of my acquaintances as regards a certain class of women at the expression but this lady with me was not a member of the class to which you refer said he quickly annoyed that margaret should rest even for a second under such an that makes me a little more doubtful as to what i should say to your first question said the lawyer i should have to knew the whole history of your acquaintance with her and that of course i neither expect nor desire you must understand this matter as far as you hear it at all exactly as it is said the lady to whom you were introduced as mrs was as pure as an angel up to the day she and i landed at i think you had best tell me no more it can do no their marriage bond good interrupted the attorney with great uneasiness of manner it certainly will do much harm to leave my story at this point was the reply at the risk of your final condemnation i entreat you to hear me through mr who had risen from his chair resumed his seat and put himself in the position of a listener though without speaking ft we were both violently in love pursued mr there was no deceit no promises no entreaties i had told her that i was engaged to he married to a girl for whom i had not the least affection good god cried mr sharply which was true to the life of my dearly loved father threatened hy any resistance to his will i had consented to have the ceremony performed after telling both mrs and that i should never let it be anything more than a string of words but when i met the lady whom you saw the first real passion of my heart sprang up and overwhelmed me i saw that to carry out my promise in america was to condemn myself to a lifetime of misery and i resolved at whatever cost to refuse but when i related the circumstance to margaret to mrs i mean she saw the matter in a light that i could not have expected admitting that she loved me that i was dearer to her than all else she declared that she would not step between me and the woman to whom i was engaged she was an orphan recently become so and nearly she had no relations to whom she could go and her future had not a single ray of sunlight in it unless she became my wife still no argument that i could make had any effect upon her she might die starve find bread in somebody s their marriage bond kitchen but she would not take a sweetheart from another even though the man swore that he would never have the marriage with that other woman performed mr had become interested at last a noble girl a magnificent girl he cried with enthusiasm you are right from a certain admitted mr sadly but the effect was as disastrous as could be conceived having determined that she could not would not marry me and that she never would love another this strange girl lived as my wife for the next fortnight under the reasoning that it would resign me when i came to reflect to parting with one who had the moral law and conventional usage of the world and you ten times wiser than she accepted this sacrifice said with a frown accepted it i loved that girl with all my soul i could not bear the thought of losing her i wanted to take her to america with me i succeeded in getting her to make the voyage which she had sworn she would not take she drew out of me a promise that when we reached new york i would find her a situation and leave her this i intended to do i meant to help her to earn an honest and then to leave the rest to fate but before we had been on shore an hour she and escaped me i have seen her since but once and then only for an instant from the window of a carriage the trembling voice and dejected manner of mr told but too plainly the sincerity of his statement she deserted you without the least quarrel asked mr when our relations were the happiest i their marriage bond she was afraid that if she remained where i could see her i would not return to what she considered my e duty and marry miss she preferred all the risks of life in a strange city with a nearly empty purse to leading me out of what seemed to her the right path have you tried seriously to find her then related the various means he had taken to gain information about margaret and told of seeing her face in the crowd as he went to the station with his bride after he had come to believe her dead you see now he added why i wrote you from the house and i think you are at least relieved from the impression that i wanted anything of you hut what was decent and ,1

were flat and clothed with and now and then a clearing disclosed a distant village a country seat or a church with blue or green sprinkled with golden stars sometimes other boats passed them laden with and hides when there seemed any danger of a collision the men in each boat uttered loud cries and rushed to and fro as if frantic passed the night more comfortably than the preceding woman made

miss jane he lived in a square house with a roof which stood less than a score of feet from the village street tall and trees grew in the tiny front yard hardly larger than a pocket handkerchief and managed among them by great and ingenuity to keep the place so shaded that a fine green moss had spread itself over the stems of the and over the somewhat fence which enclosed them they were the most and ghostly of trees and their tops were at least twice as far from the ground as was the roof of the house they the house was not one of much pretence it was a two story substantial building and there had even in the beginning been some in the way of carved the front door and in the elaborate leading of the fan light above but time had so the carving and with rest in the bundle of time less teeth at its edges it had so off the paint and had with the aid of the wind so bent and the old fan light that the glory of these things was no more the house was still in a state of preservation sufficient to bring it within the bounds of respectability but it had no longer any faintest pretence of elegance whatever may in the beginning have been its state the windows of the old house were small panes and it may have been that the terrible which was so marked in jane was the result of constant attempts to peer through them and between the branches of the at what passed in the village street â only that there was so little ever passing in the village street that this theory does not upon reflection seem within the mansion was quaint and crooked and above everything else it was narrow the furniture was plain but stately and with a fine air of having been in existence so long that it had come to be something more than mere furniture being endowed with some of the characteristics of the folk with whom it had so long associated the tall clock which had away the lives of miss jane s ancestors for three or four generations was too big to stand in the tiny hall and had to be given miss jane a corner in the sitting room that good apartment which has vanished with the advance of civilization the green silk which lined the doors of the ancient secretary was almost white with age along its folds while the were dull with time and despite all could not be rubbed into the vulgarity of appearing new there were chairs covered with such as has not been in the shops

its id the impossibility of it before the bar like a criminal the student is getting the best that study of the can give him written work should be kept within the limits of the of the individual pupil to think perhaps the best means of upon a class the vigor of s style at once and the completeness of the as a whole is that of requiring from each an expression as clear and exact as possible of just what the orator wished to effect and an estimate as critical as tlie is capable of making of how the means employed were especially adapted to carry out his such work will be useless if the teacher does the reasoning but much may be by skilful in and after the scholars have done all that they can do the may add his after the speech on may reasonably come if the required list of is being followed the sir de papers hero one with work ig ore imaginative preparation for taking up these essays with a brief aj count of the spectator and of the circumstances under which they were written the less elaborate this is the better so long as it serves the study of prose the purpose of giving the class some notion of the point of view and indeed it is to be doubted as a matter of fact any great harm would be done if even this were omitted what is needed is to interest the class in the work and facts about times and seldom effect real good in this study the will ve little trouble it is well to be sure that the readers understand beforehand such words as may be rather remote from daily speech in the account of the club march for instance the list given out for test might include such terms as these country dance humor modes square quarter game act in the first paragraph from which these words are taken are also two or three phrases should be familiar before the reading is undertaken never dressed afterward in his merry rather beloved than esteemed and justice of the the historical allusions as represented by the names lord sir george and go a into this preliminary the paper should be first read a who le with no other interruption than may come in the form of questions from the class the teacher should make no effort at anything here but intelligent reading then the paper may be given out for careful study the form of this may be varied at the pleasure of the teacher and the needs of the class the of character is the point to be talks on teaching literature most strongly brought out and this must te done but as aa possible tbe de papers necessarily seem to modern youth extremely remote from actual life as he knows it and the majority of students with whom i have talked admit that they found very quiet or in their own phrase the characters are accordingly apt to appear to them dim and unreal to be hardly more alive than the figures on an ancient this feeling cannot be overcome especially in the limited time which is at the command of the teacher of school literature yet whatever of impression a reader of the essays gets is directly to the extent to which sir and his friends from the land of and seem to the boys and girls genuine flesh and blood the chief care of the in dealing with these papers the aim to which everything else should be is to encourage and to develop the sense of reality the little touches by which the personality of the old knight is shown must be dwelt upon as each appears and in the end a summary of these may be made as a means of stating briefly but clearly sir s character constantly too by means homely enough to be clearly and easily intelligible to the class must of these passages be connected with the personal experiences of the children in the essay generally headed sir at home for instance the author remarks the study of prose sir who is veiy well with my humor rise and go to bed when i plea be dine at his own table or id mj as i think fit sit still aud nothing without me be merry the whole situation that of a notable man s visit to a country squire is utterly foreign to the pupil s probable experience he can however be made to recall occasions in which he has been considered and his wishes consulted he may or may not as a guest have tested different forms of hospitality but he easily how under given circumstances he would wish to bo treated from this he is without difficulty led to an appreciation of the consideration with which sir was intent not upon his own wishes or the ease of his but upon the pleasure of his st few boys or girls can have come to the school age without understanding what a to good spirits it is to be told to be merry and they can appreciate the common sense of the knight in thinking of this and his tact in not his guest the same thoughtful kindness is shown in the way sir protected his lion from incidentally the point may be made in passing that took this means of on the reader of the spectator the importance of the supposed writer the best preparation a teacher can make for dealing with these essays is to get clearly into his own mind the personality the even the outward appearance of each of the talks on literature dealt with it is impossible to make these quiet and delicately drawn pictures real and alive we have for them a genuine love and a sense of and i know oâ no method by which in practical work this can be ,3
ture the problem few earnest of literature have escaped those black moments when it seems perfectly evident that the one thing sure in connection with the whole business is that literature cannot be taught if they are of sensitive conscience they are likely to have wondered at times whether it is honest to go on pretending to give instruction in a branch in which instruction was so obviously the more they consider the more evident it is that if a pupil really anything in literature â aa distinguished from learning about literature â he does it himself and they cannot fail to see that as an art literature necessarily of the nature of all art the quality of being and j in any language except its own the root of whatever exists in the of modern courses of training which have to do with literature is just this fact any art as has been said often and often exists simply and solely because it and what can be expressed in no i talks on teaching literature other form a picture or a melody a statue or a poem gives delight and inspiration by which could belong to nothing to â painting or or e is at best to talk about these words cannot express wliat the work or art expresses or the work itself would be superfluous and the teacher of literature la s therefore apparently confronted with the task of to impart what language itself cannot so stated the proposition seems self contradictory and absurd indeed it too often happens that in actual practice it is so teachers weary their very souls in necessarily fruitless to achieve the impossible and fail in their work because they have not clearly apprehended what they could effect and what they should endeavor to effect in any instruction it is of great importance to recognize natural and and nowhere is this more true than in any teaching which has to do with the fine arts in other branches failure to perceive the natural of the subject limits the of the teacher in the arts it not only utterly all work hut it gives students a wrong conception of the very nature of that with which they are dealing in most studies the teacher has to do chiefly with the understanding or to put it more exactly with the intellect of the pupil in dealing with literature he reckon constantly with the also if he arouse the feelings and the problem the of his students he does not succeed in his work not only is this difficult in itself but it calls for aa condition in the which is not easily with the mood required by teaching a condition moreover which a to results much more keen than any disappointment likely to be excited by failure to carry a class triumphantly through a lesson in or history this constantly brings and this in to renewed failure in work which s requires the happiest mood on the part of the teacher and tho play of the imagination the consciousness of any lack of success the a the teacher who is able by sheer force of determination to manage the of a dull a class may fail in the attempt to make the same force carry him through an exercise in it is true that no teaching is unless the interest as well as the attention of the pupils is but whereas in other branches this is a condition in the case of literature it is a prime essential the teaching of literature moreover ia less than useless if it is not as distinguished from it is greatly to be regretted that necessity the holding of at all in a subject of which the worth is to be measured strictly by the extent to which it the imagination and the talks on teaching literature ter of the student any system of is likely to be at best a made inevitable by existing conditions and it is rendered tolerable only where teachers â often at the expense imder present school methods of a stress of body and of soul to be appreciated only by those who have taught â are able to mingle a certain amount of education with the grinding of routine examination papers hardly touch and can hardly show the results of literary training which are the only excuse for the presence of this branch in the school every faithful who is trying to do is best for the children while the of the official powers above him is face to face with the fact that the returns of and do not in the least represent his best or most laboriously achieved success under these conditions it is not strange that so many teachers are at a loss to know what they are expected to do or what they should attempt to do if the teachers in the secondary schools of this country were brought together into some palace of truth where absolute honesty was forced upon them it would be interesting and perhaps to find how few could confidently assert that ji they have clear and logical ideas in regard to the teaching of literature they would all be able to say that they dealt with certain books because such work is a prominent part of the school and many would unless restrained by the problem the truth compelling power of their add vague phrases about the minds of the a pitiful number would be forced to confess that they had no clear conception of what they were to do beyond up the memories of the young folk with certain dead information about books to be at the next and

how terrible the animal seemed an illustration the boy accepted and so we came to tbe fifth verse the range of ideas here is so much beyond the mind of any child that it was necessary to suggest most of them to go very slowly and in the end to be content with a inadequate notion of the magnificent conception i gave frankly a suggestion of the creation of all the animals at the beginning and of how the angels might have stood around like stars watching full of interest and of kindness the boy was easily made to feel as if he had seen the making oâ the deer and the lamb and the horse and of how the angels might see in one or another of the animals a help or a friend to man then suppose i said that the angels should see god make the great tiger royal and terrible wliat would they see oh a great fierce thing the lad returned do you suppose he d jump right at the deer and he make the angels think how he could how different from the other he d be yes he d have big big sharp teeth and he d lash his tail and he d put out his claws do you suppose he d his claws the way does on the leather chairs very likely he would i said at any rate the angels would think bow the other animals would he torn to pieces if the tiger got hold of them and they would think of what would happen to men perhaps they would imagine some poor talks on teaching literature woman with her baby on her back going a path iu the and how the tiger leap out suddenly and tear them both to pieces the angels could n t how god could bear to make any animal so cruel or bow ke could be willing to have anything so wicked in the world they would be sorry for all the suffering that was to come that they would throw down their and not be able to keep back the tears but angels would n t have would they i went to a shelf of the library in which we were talking and took down a volume in which i found a picture of st michael in full it is like the fire from the stars i said of course nobody ever saw an angel to know bow he would look but to show bow strong and powerful an angel might be a good many men that make pictures have painted them like knights but men that had would n t cry i should n t think angels would even the strongest men cry my boy only it has to be something tremendous to make them a thing that would make the angels water heaven with their tears must be something bo terrible that you could n t tell how sad it was well anyway i d rather be a tiger than a lamb he proclaimed rather unexpectedly very likely i assented but i think yon d rather have a lamb come after baby than a tiger illustration oh i n t want a tiger to get baby he cried with a tremor i suppose that is the way the angels might feel at the idea of the tiger s killing anybody i rejoined with a lad somewhat older one have gone on to develop the thought that to the watching the tiger leaping fierce and from the hand of the creator would be like the of evil and that in their weeping was represented all the sorrowful problem of the of evil in the universe but this on the present occasion i did not touch upon so the angels i went on couldn t keep back their tears but what did god do why he smiled the boy answered evidently with astonishment at the thought which now for the first time came home to him i should n t think he d have smiled when you were so disappointed the other day because the carriage was broken and you could n t go over to the lake in it do you remember that uncle jo laughed oh he know we could go in his he knew yes he knew began the boy and so â he stopped and looked at me with a sudden what did god know he asked seriously he must have known that somehow everything was right don t you think he knew why he had made the tiger just as he knew why he had made talks on teaching literature lamb and bo he could see that would be as it should be in the end but â but â the boy waa in face of the eternal problem as so many greater and wiser have been before him it seemed to me that we had done quite enough for once so i broke off the talk with a that we the boy s favorite game that was the end of the matter for the time but in the library of the lad a father the copy of ia ao at the page on which the tiger is printed that it ia evident that the boy with the boiled fingers of hia age has turned it often how much he made out of the talk i cannot pretend to say but at least he came to love the poem i said at the tliat i do not give the conversation which is actual as a but as an illustration the poem called for more leading on of the pupil than would many for as is one of the most imaginative of english writers his are the more subtle and profound a class moreover cannot be treated always with the same deliberation as that which is natural in the case of a single child but the essential principle i ,3

for he was not again interrupted by whose deference for her husband s superior sagacity seems to have been more habitual than her s of old our unhappy heroine pursued her way home her mind filled with thick coming and bitter fancies revolving over and over again the circumstances of john s narrative he had thrown a new light on the character of her lover and she blamed herself that faults had seemed so dim to her which were now so glaring she was not far from coming to the result which we trust our readers have expected from the â new england tale integrity purity of her character if i had

of moral how could he continue to play his part how keep his front to the enemy with this poison of indifference stealing through his veins he tried to brace himself with the remembrance of his wife s scorn he had not forgotten the note on which their conversation had closed if he had ever wondered how she would receive the truth he wondered no longer â she would despise him but this lent a new to his temptation since her contempt would be a refuge from his own he said to himself that since he no longer cared for the consequences he could at least himself of speaking in self defence what he wanted now was not but his wife s indignation might still reconcile him to himself therein lay his one hope of her scorn was the moral that he needed her comprehension the one that could heal him when they left the dinner he was so afraid of speaking that he let her drive home alone and went to the club with the ix t te rose next morning with the resolve to know what thought of him it was not in a haven but lying to in a storm â he felt the need of a temporary lull in the turmoil of his sensations he came home late for they were dining alone and he knew that they would have the evening together when he followed her to the drawing room after dinner he thought himself on the point of speaking but as she handed him his coffee he said involuntarily i shall have to carry this off to the study i ve got a lot of work to night alone in the study he cursed his cowardice what was it that had withheld him a certain bright seemed to keep him at arm s length she was not the kind of woman whose compassion could be there was no chance of slipping past the â he would never take her by surprise well â why not face her then what he shrank from could be no worse than what he was enduring he had pushed back his chair and turned to go upstairs when a new expedient presented itself what if instead of telling her he were to let her find out for herself and watch the effect of the discovery before speaking in this way he made over to chance the burden of the revelation the idea had been suggested by the sight of the the s check he had deposited the the money but the notice accompanying it dropped from his note case as he cleared his table for work it was the usual in such cases and revealed clearly enough that he was the of a on margaret s letters it would be impossible for to read it without understanding at once that the letters had been written to him and that he had sold them he sat downstairs till he heard her ring for the to put out the lights then he went up to the with a bundle of papers in his hand was just rising from her seat and the fell on the deep roll of hair that her brow like the of a temple her face had often the high secluded look of a shrine and it was this touch of awe in her beauty that now made him feel himself on the brink of lest the feeling should control him he spoke at once i ve brought you a piece of work â a lot of old bills and things that i want you to sort for me some are not worth keeping â but you be able to judge of that there may be a letter or two among them â nothing of much account but i don t like to throw away the whole lot without having them looked over and i have n t time to do it myself he held out the papers and she took them with a smile that seemed to recognize in the service he asked the intention of making amends for the incident of the previous day are you sure i shall know which to keep the h quite sure he answered easily and besides none are of much importance the next morning he invented an excuse for leaving the house without seeing her and when he returned just before dinner he found a visitor s hat and stick in the hall the visitor was who was just taking leave he had risen but remained seated and their attitude gave the impression of a that had prolonged itself beyond the limits of speech both turned a surprised eye on and he had the sense of walking into a room grown suddenly empty as though their thoughts were dispersed by his approach he felt the clutch of his old fear what if his wife had already the papers and had told of her discovery well it was no news to that was in receipt of a on the letters a sudden resolve to know the worst made him lift his eyes to his wife as the door closed on but had risen also and bending over her writing table with her back to was beginning to speak i m dining out to night â you don t mind my you sent me word just now that she had an extra ticket for the last concert she told me to say how sorry she was that she had n t two but i knew you would n t be sorry she ended with a laugh that had the effect of being a strayed echo of mrs s and before could speak she had added with her the hand on the door mr stayed so late that i ve hardly time to dress the concert begins early and at half past seven stood alone in the empty room that seemed somehow full ,10
surrender to the spell of the landscape one to indefinite it is the season when through the winter of the spring breaks with a hundred tender tints â pale green of crops white snow of and fire of scarlet under the grey smoke of olive groves from heights among the cork trees the little towns huddled about their keeps across the pine forests at the dazzling blue and purple of the coast and between the heights mild valleys down â valleys with fields of roses acres of vine meadows sown with and cold streams rushing from the chestnut forests below the bald grey peaks among the s by the to peaks are lonely ruined remains of old and but no great names are attached to these fallen and the little towns below have no connection with the main lines of history it is all a tranquil thick with local tradition little floating fragments of association and legend but art and history seem to have held back from it as from some charmed region too calm too complete to be rudely touched to great issues it was the that drove us from this it with dust and glare and causing us to take refuge north of the sea board there in a air and on a radiant morning we left behind and followed the to approaching the city from the east one may get a memorable impression by following the outer circuit of its walls to the de which opens on the place just below the great rock of the palace seen thus from without is like a toy model of a city and this impression of artificial completeness is renewed by a flight through france when from the rock perched terrace below the palace one looks out on the valley and its of mountains in the light al air which gives a finely precision to the remotest objects the landscape has an character an effect of presenting with a pre on detail its sharp edged ruins its bridge its little walled towns on definite points of rock the river winding through the holds its yellow curve between thin of and sharp cliffs and even the hills have the clear of the blue peaks in the shoulder of the rising above them to the north with the firmness of an antique marble this southern of edge gives even to the of the piled up church and palace an quality and makes the long of

of successive in the outward aspect of its capital only the rome of the has left a mark on the town which lived with so vigorous and personal life from the days when it was a city and a trading station of and which when it grew too small for its adventurous brood sent rulers to both shores of the north sea and the fact that the theatre and the arch survive while the orange of and princes has been quite wiped out and even of s great century fortress to the ground â this of the imperial by a flight through france monuments rising through the blown dust of nearly a thousand years gives a image of the way in which the roman spirit has persisted through the of history to learn that these very monuments have been turned to base uses by barbarous prince â the arch converted into a fortified de the theatre into an of the main fortress â adds to their splendour one with the image of a whole from such fragments among these the theatre now quite stripped of ornament produces its effect only by means of its size and of the beautiful sweep of its lines but the great golden brown arch â standing alone in a wide grassy square â keeps on three sides a mask of and column and a rich of fruit and of and battle scenes all this is roman â vigorously carved and somewhat applied one looks in vain for the sensitive ornament of the arch of saint in which mâ e s keen eye saw a of the

country with hills passing by the seat of a foundation â of which the great ii was prince and prior â and by is which under the of became the capital of the the french dominion in france like too many old towns in this part of france as once a strongly fortified place has suffered its castle to fall in ruins and swept away its towers and to make room for as though eager to all traces of its long

wife no longer wrote to each other the same thought appeared to strike and they walked across the lawn in silence hastening their steps involuntarily as though to escape the oppressive weight of the words which had passed between them but was unwilling that this fruitless sense of oppression should be the final of their talk and when they reached the upper terrace she paused and turned to as she did so the light from an window fell on her face which glowed with the inner brightness kindled in it by moments of strong feeling i am sure of one thing â will be very glad that you have come she

unnatural mother sacrificing her child s prospects to further s enterprise and now conscious of a vague against the little girl as the chief cause of the which had so soon clouded the skies of her second marriage then again there were moments when s rosy bloom reminded her bitterly of the child she had lost â the son on whom her had been fixed it seemed to her non thai if their boy bad lived she might have kept s us the fruit of the tree love and have played a more important part in his life and brooding on the tragedy of the child s sickly existence she resented the contrast of s brightness and vigour the result was that in her treatment of her daughter she between moments of exaggerated devotion and days of neglect never long happy away from the little girl yet restless and self in her presence after her talk with she felt more than usually disturbed as she always did when her impulses of self exposure had subsided s mind was not made for and chance had it with unintelligible problems she felt herself the victim of circumstances to which her imagination attributed the deliberate malice that children to the furniture they run against in playing this helped her to cultivate a sense of helpless injury and to disdain in advance the advice she was perpetually seeking how absurd it was for instance to suppose that a girl could understand the feelings of a married woman s suggestion that she should humble herself still farther to merely left in s mind a sense of being misunderstood and by those to whom she turned in her extremity and she said to herself in a phrase that sounded well in her own ears that sooner or later every woman must learn to fight her battles alone â â fruit of the ds in this mood she entered the room where was at supper with her and enveloped the child in a whirl of passionate caresses but had inherited the temper and her mother s always had a effect on her she returned a small of s kisses and then with an air of relief

that he should have done as she did then the usual reaction of distrust set in and he asked himself why she who had so little of the conventional attitude toward money should now develop this unexpected and so the old question presented itself in another shape if she had nothing to reproach herself for why was it intolerable to her to live on s money the fact that she was doing no actual service at did not account for her scruples â she would have been the last person to think that a sick servant should be of his pay her reluctance could come only from that hidden cause of which had prompted her the fruit of the tree departure and which now forced her to even the merely material links between herself and her past on his return to had tried to find in these considerations a reason for his deep it was his wife s course which still cast a tor doubt on what he had his will to accept and put behind him and he now told himself that the perpetual sense of her absence was due to this uneasy consciousness of what it meant of the secrets it enveloped and held back from him in actual truth every of his being missed her he lacked her at every turn she had been at once the partner of his task and the pays into which he escaped from it the thought which gave meaning to the life he had chosen yet never let him that there was a larger richer life outside to which he was rooted by deeper and more things than any abstract ideal of his love had p r v e d his identity saved him from shrinking into the mere which the social is in danger of becoming unless the passion is balanced and a little by a merely human one and now this was lost forever and his deepest pain lay in that he could not regain itâ even by casting off and choosing the but richer individual existence that her love might once have offered his life was in the fruit of the tree one oi not two united self and other self were from the roots â whichever portion fate him to would be but a half live fragment of

the three months on that tide of swift action that sweeps the wrecked spirit over so many sunken of fear and despair the knowledge that he was better able to deal with the question than any one who might have taken his place â this conviction which was presently confirmed by the of the strike helped to make the sense of his immediate usefulness that other doubt as to the final value of such

he pondered over his reply this sudden visit took him somewhat by surprise and he felt greatly pe how to answer these two strangers who had so unexpectedly offered their services surrounded as he waa

it would never do to lose the of a man who could bring money to the amount of millions to forward the cause he meditated over the matter for some time and then turned to survey his guests with an inquiring look on bis face conspiracy if you speak truly â he began with marked hesitation interrupted him impatiently of course we speak truly do you think that either i or my friend looks like a traitor we desire to do this thing through a love of adventure and rest assured that both my money and the major s services will be of great value to the cause i wiu trust you said extending a hand to each yes i will trust you bonds or oaths of any kind you are gentlemen i know and would not betray an princess whose fortunes are now at their lowest ebb old servant as he was of the house of the thought of such a thing caused his voice to shake with emotion but speedily recovering himself he went on speaking in firmer tones you are right in your regarding meetings at this house most of the members of our party are in london and we meet here to concert measures for the princess once more on the throne the republic is now anything but popular its leaders consulting their own selfish interests are the people and the army is thoroughly with a few brave spirits ready to act us at the right time we hope to raise the royal standard and while the country is yet in confusion seize on the capital for queen it is a splendid idea said his eyes flashing at the prospect and when do you expect to do this in london we cannot say for just now we have no money money money repeated the in despair we need a great deal several of the republican leaders particularly can be and would then assist us to restore the queen but without money we can do nothing i will supply the money how much can you give asked eagerly as much as you require â a million if need be impossible said the a private english gentleman cannot have so much money at his disposal or if so it cannot be realized at once we want ready money you shall have ready money the turned towards with an inquiring look it is true said that individual with a confident nod of his head my friend mr is able to get the money you want the hardly the evidence of his own ears still looked doubtful come said growing tired of all this suspicion are you going to accept my offer or shall i withdraw no no stammered seizing his hand i do accept and that on behalf of my royal mistress one thing i must ask said returning the pressure â that my offer be kept secret from all save the princess but i must tell the leaders of party it is unless they know that the money is certain not one of them will dare to strike a blow a lot the major who had no morality himself inform the council said after a pause money to the amount of one million will be to the royal cause but do not mention my name no i keep silent on that point and you will tell the princess of my offer yes to morrow i will do so and i have no doubt that she will grant you an audience do you propose to remain by no means cried quickly i and the major both wish to in your schemes we will go with you to then you will have to be disguised said significantly not at all said the major quickly did i not hear you say that you had a villa on the black sea yes i am going there at the end of the season the very thing cried striking the table with his clenched fist we can go there in the ordinary course of things and it can be made the of the movement capital i said who had been listening to all this with sparkling eyes nothing could be better once you are settled there all suspicion will be at an end and then the princess later on in london can take up her abode at the villa with your money mr we can sow among the republican troops far and wide all those we gain over to the cause can meet at your villa and when all is ready we can you don t think the present government of will suspect me asked anxiously by no means why should they to all appearance the country is comparatively at peace you are a wealthy foreigner who has bought a villa there for pleasure they will suspect nothing and the princess can go disguised â say as the maid of your wife oh it will be all right believe me what with your money your villa and the present among the we will gain our cause almost without a blow and then and then we will proclaim queen once she is on her throne she will not forget you mr or you either major the was quite at the glorious prospect which he ,12

kept his house in order and prepared his meals when he opened the door to night the little rooms were illuminated with two candles and made fragrant with the of chicken and cakes to which aunt was all her energies and for the first time perhaps in his life he failed to greet these attractions with his usual air of good cheer he threw his hat into a chair and stretching himself out upon the lay there his hands clasped above his head and his eyes fixed upon the glow of the fire in the adjoining room where aunt was at work a gentleman he said half aloud that s it by a gentleman he remembered it afterwards as a curious coincidence that he should have busied his mind so with his subject in a manner so unusual with him his imagination not being sufficiently vivid to help him out of his difficulty to his own satisfaction he with it patiently to it again and again and turn in connection with the de claim ing it over until it assumed a greater interest than at first he only it with an effort when going to bed later than usual he made up his mind to compose himself to sleep good lord he said turning on his side and addressing some unseen presence representing the vexed question don t keep a man awake settle it yourself and finally sank into in the midst of his mental struggle about the middle of the night he awakened he felt that something had startled him from his sleep but could not tell what it was a few seconds he lay without moving listening and as he listened there came to his ear the sound of a horse s feet treading the earth outside the door the animal itself breathing heavily as if it had been ridden hard and almost as soon as he aroused to recognition of this fact there came a sharp tap on the door and a man s voice crying he knew the voice at once and unexpected as the summons was felt he was not altogether unprepared for it though he could not have offered even the explanation for the feeling he s in trouble he said as he sat up quickly in bed something s gone wrong he rose and in a few seconds opened the door he had guessed rightly it was the stranger the moonlight fell full upon the side of the house and the road and the panting horse stood revealed in a bright light which gave the man s face a ghostly look added to his natural as he leaned forward tom saw that he was as much exhausted as was the animal he had ridden in connection with the de claim i want to find a doctor or a woman who can give help to another he said there ain t a doctor within fifteen miles from here began tom he stopped short what he saw in the man s face checked him look here he said is it your wife the man made a sharp gesture of despair she s dying i think he said hoarsely and there s not a human being near her good lord cried tom good lord the sweat started out on his forehead he remembered what had said of her youth and her pale face and he thought of and from this thought sprang a sudden recollection of the deserted medical career in which he had been regarded as so a failure he had never mentioned it since he had cut himself off from the old life and the women for whose children he had prescribed with some success now and then had considered the ends achieved only the natural results of his gifts but the thought of the desolate young creature lying there alone struck deep he listened one moment then made his resolve go to the stable he said and throw a saddle over the horse you will find there i know something of such matters myself and i shall be better than nothing with a woman s help i have a woman here who will follow us he went into the back room and awakened aunt get up he said and saddle the mule and follow me as soon as you can to the cabin in s hollow the wife of a man who lives there needs a woman with her come quickly in connection with the de claim when he returned to the door his horse stood there the stranger sitting on his own and holding the bridle tom mounted in silence but once finally seated he turned to his companion now strike out he said there were four miles of road before them but they scarcely rein until they were within sight of the hollow and the few words they exchanged were the questions and answers the cabin was built away from the road on the side of the hill and leaving their horses at the foot of the slope they climbed it together when they reached the door the stranger stopped and turned to tom there is no sound inside he faltered i dare not â go m tom strode by him and pushed the door open in one corner of the room was a roughly and upon it lay a girl her pale face turned sideways upon the pillow it was as if she lay by some wave of agony which had just passed over her her breath was faint and rapid and great drops of sweat stood out upon her young drawn face tom drew a chair forward and sat down beside her he lifted one of her hands touching it gently but save for a slight quiver of the eyelids she did not stir a sense of awe fell upon him it s

instruction he ought to be dismissed the college must judge the conditions under which its work may be most properly and accomplished and to achieve its purpose it may justly limit the liberty of its

the streets of new york at christmas show that we have taken the whole earth to drop into our christmas the festival might be celebrated by coming to the city merely to walk the streets and view the

youth and beauty and love that there are age and care and poverty also then perhaps the good fortune of the meeting is not wholly mine for o beautiful two of these things at least must come even to you there will be a time when you will no longer go out to dinner or only very quietly in the family i shall be gone then but other old book in white will inherit my tastes and on summer to see what i loved to see they will not pause i fear in buying apples to look at the old lady in venerable cap who is rolling by in the carriage they will worship another you will not wear diamonds or any more only one pearl upon your blue finger â your engagement ring grave and will hand you down to dinner and the group of polished youth who gather around the yet of that day will look at you sitting quietly upon the sofa and say softly she must have been very handsome in her time all this must be for consider how few years since it was your grandmother who was the by whose side the handsome young men longed to sit and pass expressive your grandmother was the of a half century ago although you cannot fancy her young she is associated in your mind with caps and dark dresses you can believe mary queen of or or to have been young and blooming although they belong to old and dead centuries but not your grandmother think of those who shall believe the same of you â you who today are the very flower of youth might i plead with you â i who should be too happy to receive one of those graciously beaming bows that i see you bestow upon young men in passing â i would ask you to bear that thought with you always not to your sunny smile but to give it a more subtle grace wear in your summer this little leaf of it will not be the skull at the feast it will rather be the tender thoughtful ess in the face of the young for the years pass like summer clouds and the children of yesterday are the wives and mothers of to day even i do sometimes discover the mild eyes of my fixed upon my face as if searching for the bloom which she remembers there in the days long ago when we were young she will never see it there again any more than the flowers she held in her hand in our old spring yet the tear that slowly as she is not grief that the bloom has faded from my cheek but the sweet consciousness that it can never fade from my heart and as her eyes fall upon her work again or the children her lap to hear the old fairy tales they already know by heart my wife is dearer to me than the sweetheart of those days long ago my of them lie in the west but the greater part are in spain you may see my possessions any evening at sunset when their and flash against the horizon it gives me a feeling of importance as a proprietor that they are visible â to my eyes at least any part of the world in which i chance to be in my long voyage around the cape of good hope to india the only voyage i ever made when i was a boy and a if i fell or sank into a reverie of all the pleasant homes i had left behind i had but to wait until sunset and then looking towards the west i beheld my and towers brightly as if to salute and welcome me so in the city if i get vexed and wearied and cannot find my solace in forth at dinner time to contemplate the gay world of youth and beauty hurrying to the of fashion or if i observe that years are deepening their tracks around the eyes of my wife i go quietly up to the house top towards evening and refresh myself with a distant prospect of my estates it is as dear to me as that of to the poet gray and if i sometimes wonder at such moments whether i shall find those as fair as they appear i am suddenly reminded that the night air may be and descending i enter the little parlor where sits and surprise that precious woman by exclaiming with the poet s pensive enthusiasm â thought would destroy their paradise no more where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise also had possessions in the west and as i read aloud the romantic story of his life my voice when i come to the point in which it is related that sweet of the land mingled with the sea air as the admiral s fleet approached the shores that tropical birds flew out and fluttered around the ships glittering in the sun the gorgeous promises of the new country that boughs perhaps with blossoms not all decayed floated out to welcome the strange wood from which the craft were then i cannot restrain myself i think of the gorgeous visions i have seen before i have even undertaken the journey to the west and i cry aloud to what sun bright birds and gorgeous blossoms and celestial will float out to us my as we approach our western possessions the placid raises her eyes to mine with a reproof so delicate that it could not be trusted to words and after a moment she her knitting and i proceed these are my western estates but my finest castles are in spain it is a country romantic and my castles are all of perfect proportions and set in the most picturesque situations i have never been to spain myself but i have naturally conversed ,16
readiness but there is mrs to be considered mrs does not expect me to day he answered quickly and i can very soon explain matters to her when we meet here comes the will you allow me oh yes since you are so kind answered and the next minute she was being helped up the steep ladder to the top of the where they seated themselves comfortably and were presently rolling on towards town in a moment the whole aspect of things seemed to have changed for the intense feeling of desolation which had almost overwhelmed her had disappeared and in its place there was a sense of rest and which was the strangest as well as the sweetest experience she had ever known you don t know much of london i suppose it is not possible seeing you have been so short a time here and your opportunities must necessarily have been few have you to return to mrs s at any given time at the hour oh no i have the whole afternoon and evening at my disposal but i have never gone out at all except to church in the evening well will you allow me to take care of you this afternoon this is going to suppose we take a train there to court and have a pull on the river on sunday afternoon said doubtfully i understand your objection but in this case i hardly think it holds good we should not be any one but just as you like i would not for the world suggest anything which would vex or trouble you to look back upon only it seems a shame to spend this glorious afternoon in town and i can promise to bring you back in time for church if you wish mrs will wonder what has become of me murmured oh but i shall tell her exactly what happened said mrs knows me well enough she may be surprised but that will be all shall we go to then if you wish answered is at the hour at the delicious sense of sweetness which stole into her heart i told my mother about you said presently she was interested beyond measure she once knew a dear old scotch lady who d part of every season in london possibly you may have heard of her she had a place in â lady lady i exclaimed in surprise she was my mother s aunt and brought her up indeed said almost equally surprised you will remember i spoke when we met of a humble woman whom i knew she was at one time maid to lady and is now married in what is her name asked christian christian cried i have often heard my mother speak of her is she still alive yes so far as i know i saw her some weeks ago she has a shop not very far from where i live sometimes i look in when i am out for a stroll i always enjoy a talk with her at the hour my mother used to have a town house next door to lady s but when we fell on evil days it had to be sold sat in silence for a few moments thinking how small the world was and how odd that they should have discovered this curious bond between them never saw lady she said presently my mother s marriage was such a blow to her that she never saw her afterwards and she willed everything away from her although she had been brought up as her own daughter yes i have heard so said my mother has often spoken of el as the most beautiful girl she had ever seen that was your mother s name yes oh yes said trembling with her emotion and she was beautiful she is beautiful still only trouble has changed her so much she is still alive i think you said yes may i tell you what has happened it is a strange and dreadful story but i think i bear it better if you knew touched by the manner with which she spoke was for the is at the hour i moment at a loss what to say he was no less amazed at his own absorbing interest in the girl by his side an interest which had advanced in leaps and bounds until he felt that what was of moment to her was almost of equal moment to him you know i shall be glad to listen if you care to tell but remember i asked no questions it matters nothing to me what your story is i am interested in you alone but i wish to tell you said i wish to explain why i am here away from all my kindred and i think somehow that you will be able to help me then in a few words she told him the whole events of the past month so did she present the picture that it seemed to stand before s mental vision finished in every detail even the few words in which she spoke of her brother presented a faithful portrait which struck perhaps as much as anything she had said and so you have really come to london to seek them he said and there was the most infinite compassion in his voice and look a well nigh impossible task at the hour i see that now she said mournfully i may live here for years and be no nearer than i am at this moment yet it is even possible that they might be living in the next street he said stranger things have happened do happen in this wonderful city well miss will you place this matter in my hands leave me to act as think wise oh should like to answered but there are some things i must consider my mother â it would be terrible to her to think ,17
beside her and so for a minute they looked in each other s pale faces and then a sob broke from one of them but it was not why are you so sorry v she said her hand lying cold and still in his then it is true i was not quite sure â â there are so many men in the a story of a sin world but now i know and you must not be sorry for me â but for her she drew her hand away and put it to her head trying to remember something came to my mind as my senses were slipping away she said all love is lost save god alone that was it it was a strange thought to come into my head was it not i have been very happy she looked up wistfully at frank but his eyes were bent on the ground as he stood before her i always said that i should die young she went on in a voice as like her own as a s song is to a s and i was sorry but that was nothing and so he stayed away so long because because and that is why he did not ask me before he went â â â and lady was right and and no doubt he loved her once she added below her breath shaken out of her by a sharp headlong of that jealousy whose fierce pain makes a woman humble and shows her to her own heart helpless at the feet of her master you love him cried frank as one who speaks against his will she dropped her head on her hands love him ay she loved yet â love as we must love as we do love for evil as for good and the deeper the sin so it be not against ourselves the more closely we cling to the sinner we loved him in his honour â shall we thrust him from us in his shame but to the story of a sin woman who has always looked up that moment is a terrible one when she sees her other self laid in the dust and that henceforth she must love him not for that better part that might live for ever but as a human living that even while she to it may be resolved into nothing and so escape her but i will give him back to her she said scarcely above a whisper i will learn to live without him only i must get away before he comes back â and you will help me frank she will forgive me perhaps when she knows that i suffer too how strong in the thought how powerless in the action is this same will that does not take into account human flesh and blood habit duty nothing that we know and hold on by even in that moment of human feeling fast and asked what life would be without him love cried out that it starved and would be fed the shadow of sin cleared from that beloved face and left only â that something that she loved she said to herself that she would be dumb deaf blind but to his side she must creep and cling the man s seemed far away the man most near in that moment of strong impulse towards him why do you not speak for him y she said looking up with some of the old fire in her eye you loved him once â â â and he loved you ro story of a sin too though he was to you but i made him that he would have spoken for j ou â he would have told me not to believe it frank turned suddenly and across his brain there flashed one of those wild ideas that have stamped a man ere now as hero or madman â a moment and he had adopted it as one of those forlorn hopes that by splendid courage or audacity have now and again been pushed to a victory that has reversed every law of he drew his breath hard and said you have been very happy and please god you shall be happy still my will not break your heart and it was not a very long misery for you after all for a moment he took her little cold hand in his then it and stood apart poor frank she said with the ghost of a wan smile you would make me happy if you could i think you would even give your life for me but you cannot give me this dear no one not even ae can make me happy now can i not he said and moved yet a little farther away but at least i can tell you â he paused and went paler than she â the truth no she cried her face flaming up that is his affair not yours no he said and in the ring of his voice there was less of entreaty than command it is mine looked up this was a new frank who stood story of a sin before her â no boyish sweetheart dependent on her will but a man as strong to love ay and to sin maybe as mr himself he said and his voice was as one who spoke by there are other men in the world besides mr can t you think that it might be some one you know some one you called your friend s arms fell to her sides she hardly seemed to breathe as she gazed at him then like a who at the hour sights land she flung them high above her head and it was she said for a moment there was a dead silence broken only by the shrill whisper of the lark in the meadow hard by then it was not something in ,17
give us points in she said oh with a sudden cry there are father and mother â there and she pointed far below to a black crowd of people that seemed to wave welcome at us like a wash line in a gale i made them out at last â a man whose look of fire and distinction told even at that distance and a bright faced woman whose gestures energy and joy as the boat made its last deliberate movement and came to a full stop there you are said s voice behind me we will say good bye now as i shall not wait to get my things through the customs â will see to that and i shall go straight on to the railway station write me what the the doctor says â and i ll wire you what progress we make good bye old chap â god bless you â what address holland house good luck to you good bye miss he said and then we all down the and somehow i lost the girl but found her afterwards sitting beside her mother on a trunk waiting for the custom house officials her father moved briskly to and fro using his very considerable influence to get us attended to quickly and his his snap his perfectly shod foot and well hand were a surprise to me with my idea of the male american while as to brains i could understand now why was what she was and from whom she got those wonderful brown eyes the got off first with a cordial invitation to me to call on them in the of â then tom who had been to by the officials as was his unhappy wont came up to me like some big awkward who fears a kick and said tm near the captain anyone will tell you where it is and drove quickly away in a hired carriage while i followed in another i formed no impression of the streets through which we drove corresponding to our poorer part of london it was only afterwards that i knew how to the of the jew population by the number of articles hung out to dry on one day in the week but afterwards when we turned into fifth avenue passing from a of elevated railway and into a region that somewhat on a huge scale to our bond street soon i began to get my bearings and on at my hotel was met by a surprise for an amazed voice sang out captain and i turned to see young of the whom i had last seen in town and home on long leave standing on the steps before me he had an innocent clean shaven face and the blue eyes i ever saw in a man s head while of the mischief that lay behind those eyes few people had any idea but i was really delighted to see him knowing well enough that two englishmen of one mind can form a extremely useful in a strange city and be practically independent of all outside society what are you doing here i inquired h a little week end run over â not an i assure you awful weather for you and â another of his reckless i suppose i m not going with him are you putting up here what luck and we went in they ve put me up for the union club he said when i had made my arrangements and no doubt they will you awful good sort the these american men are he added and if they have no sporting idle set as with us at least they have no vulgar rich one that does nothing but amuse itself there isn t a man but himself for at least a few hours daily in business thereby setting some of us lazy englishmen an excellent example but it s funny the way they sit in the window with their hats on and stare at the women who pass while at home we sit without our hats and don t in the least care whether a pretty woman goes by or not was frankly indifferent to the fair sex and had been heard to remark that in these days women are much more interested in the woman s question than men are but i thought he might get a lesson or two on the subject if he remained in america long enough and especially if i introduced him to when i had arranged for rooms and changed my clothes i found him waiting for me in the hall looking wretched if there s one thing i can t stick he said it s the awful of the houses and stores â the blast as i call it â makes you feel like a cheap penny â it s the heat you should be warned against in new york not the cold â which is perfectly dry and there s always a jolly blue sky overhead i nodded for already i felt irritated annoyed by that hot house like air and almost gasping for fresh air seized my hat let us go out i said and great coats be hanged i then got my first real impression of new york which struck me as very brilliant very shallow all on view as it were from end to end every good it possessed displayed in its one endless shop window with apparently twice as many people in it as our capital we live and die here in cars said the women go to the opera in em in and â and hang on by three deep while the man his by a special of providence youve got to lie down right in the track to stop em and out of sheer they ll leave you there if the spirit moves em as to except off fifth avenue and central park you never see one as ,17
fallen sound asleep on his shoulder mr signed to the woman to go and with exultation thought that at least the child had remembered him in all the rapture of s return and when in an hour s time he carried her back to the nursery he had so far softened towards the boy that had they met then a better f might have been established between them but was not there with jealous heart and counting each moment an eternity he had for a long while waited his little sister s return but when half an hour had passed he went where he had always gone when in trouble â to his mother s picture no matter i that the room was in darkness she was a reality to him and all things good and evil in his heart he laid before those lovely mother s eyes that never failed to bring healing to his soul mother he said aloud and with his hand on the picture she is my little baby you gave her into my charge and i ve taken care of her and now father s taking her away from me as he used to try to take you away if only you could come down and speak to me mother mother v but next morning broke fair and bright and the boy was awakened by little who ran in of offence and when they had together went out on one of those delightful that included every and upon the estate the boy missed at every turn but as by mr s expressed commands was kept in ignorance of what had lately occurred he supposed that and her husband had been sent away for some pleasing to his father both man and wife had been kind to the neglected children in their way and served them honestly whether from fear of mr s unexpected return or in part to their secret guilt might never be known s spirits had been steadily rising all the morning and when with blooming roses on their cheeks they returned home a httle after one to find a real s dinner ready in the nursery the boy who had been lunch with his father threw off the last of the jealous fears that had tormented him over night and kissing his darling sat down her joyfully to their feast nothing had been forgotten that a boy from school could desire and the nurse smiled as she served him and the table with her spoon when he ate three of ff the woman thought mr was very wâ ff in thus giving up the child to her brother not knowing that he as equally avoided the appearance of jealousy as hitherto he had avoided its reality regarding it as a vice of the weak â not one that ever attacked the strong he remained within doors all that day but none came to disturb him though afar off he tho i i e a children s voices and caught a glimpse of them once or twice in the garden he recognised the that safely before the fell but when lights were kindled in the opposite wing he wrapped himself in his cloak and went through the village to a spot that he rarely left for a day but others had been before him on this occasion for a j wreath of lay on his wife s grave and of â smelling things laid here and there by a boy s i formal hand and mr thought that his son claimed the older as well as the younger though had never for one second placed her children before her husband or so he had believed â did he believe it now when the was away her mother s image and his thoughts to night were less of grief for the lost than jealousy for the living his life was emphatically a march he could y die but he could not and seemed i to have come to him to night as he told himself that was first would always be first in the child s t heart and if so then no matter what it cost him he â would leave her let her cling to make him her sole idol for himself no second place in any human heart would he accept on his way home he went to lane and asked s friend if she had delivered the message he sent the woman replied that she had it but did not expect a reply then i shall have to go to her said mr as he departed and at the thought the blood stirred hke sap in his veins for vengeance though put during the ss s past weeks had yet to be satisfied and it would require no great effort to break bis home and go forth once more on the quest that hitherto bad ended but in failure but when long after his dinner hour mr reached his study to find a token of little s late presence in the shape of a dropped shoe knot he picked it up and half forgave her though not the faintest intention crossed his mind to return her good visit next day was cold and wet and t ae children did not stir abroad but lest should draw her to him mr went out for a long ride that lasted till after dark and on bis return home knew well enough that no such of recollection as bad seized her the night before bad reminded her of him to night for a child of three is essentially one and no save at odd moments it goes where love is but rarely seeks it so that mr into tbe background and occupied s whole thoughts just now the man had up himself to the fight but who can with a child s whim no more natural phase of nature can be found than ,17

rich or well soil or the of human it begins to bear fruit between its fourth and tenth year according to soil and a well placed generous tree bears from one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty

so mien is actually feet below its being feet it is a well built and clean town with a fine wall and a river front well protected by a handsome of and with eight faces the is and when the water is high boats can descend to in six or seven days there is an enormous traffic from mien to the capital principally of sugar and tobacco the busy and crowded streets are lined with shops in which every conceivable article in iron is displayed from instruments to and articles in wrought iron there are fully half a mile of such shops the great trade of mien however is in to silk and much cotton is woven in its neighbourhood the shops display german and foreign and printed besides temple furniture and the shops with their varied and in many cases costly contents show that the neighbourhood has great power the passage through the thronged streets took nearly an hour but all was quiet i was not allowed to go to an inn but was most kindly received at the church mission house a dark and not agreeably situated house in a crowded chinese quarter inhabited by the two ladies who after four years of patience and difficulties have effected a permanent in what is well known as a hostile city they spent the first two years at an inn and so little were they thought of that the when urged to take some action against them replied what does it matter they are only women during this time all their attempts to rent a house failed because the officials threatened to beat and anyone letting a house to a foreigner but a fortnight before my visit a man ruined by smoking let them have for ten years the place into which they had just moved close to the great temple of access to it is through an area inhabited by chinese â a forlorn dirty yard â and through an inner yard full of chinese who seemed to be always gambling or smoking a third yard being the newly acquired property from which some of the chinese had not yet cleared out the two last courts are by the church missionary society and have subsequently been improved and made and the memorial a with a ward under dr a qualified english doctor has been opened in the outer of the two it was interesting to see what in china have to undergo in the stage of residence in a chinese city the house was utterly out of repair â dirty broken â half the paper torn off the windows and the so deep and low that daylight could scarcely enter there was an open guest hall in the middle used constantly for classes and services endless parties of chinese passed in and out all day long holes in the remaining windows opening every door that was not locked missionary luxury taking everything they could lay hands on and the noise was only from four to six a m â men shouting babies screaming dogs barking and going off temple bells and drums beating â no rest quiet or privacy there were two services in the guest hall on sunday conducted by mr the of the mission and several classes for women also but all in a â men playing cards outside the throng men and women sitting for a few minutes some laughing scornfully others talking in loud tones some lighting their pipes and a very few really interested this is not the work which many who go out as on a wave of enthusiasm expect but this is what these good people undergo day after day and month after month the place where the two ladies spent two years consisted of a guest room at an inn in one of the most crowded of the city streets a living room through it a kitchen through that and for a sleeping room a above the living room reached by a ladder just under the there was no light in any room except from a paper window into the semi dark passage the floors were mud wood water and all things had to be carried in and out through the living room no privacy was possible the temperature hung at about for weeks in summer there were the ceaseless visits of crowds of ill bred chinese women staying for hours at a time and without and in the inn seldom pausing there was the din of a big chinese city under these circumstances their love and patience had won twelve women to be christians mr and mrs of the china inland mission and a thirteen months baby arrived before i left he very ill of fever they were swept out of in the losing all their possessions and with this infant had been moving for seven months having lastly been driven out of by the rebellion during the whole seven months they had never been in one place more than twelve days it is a grave question whether married men and married women ought to be placed in regions of precarious security mr s house

horror over by the last cold what is to prevent my coming upon one which is not over well so be it he added after a momentary pause i must take what comes presently he began to feel an occasional at his ears and he heard a sharp sound upon the ice around him as if of falling snow or hail this was not very favorable though as the wind seemed still to be rising m did not complain the only danger that he thought of was the which snow would make to the movement of his there was however another danger the falling snow though very little reached the ground and obscured the atmosphere he soon lost all distinct vision of the shores now and then a dark mass came into view and moved slowly off behind him as he went on but he could distinguish nothing plainly the moon entirely disappeared and he seemed flying along over a scene of wintry desolation the earth the boat he draws near to an island his very narrow escape turned into gray ice beneath him and the atmosphere into and snow above at this time there suddenly loomed up before him a dark mass dimly seen but advancing with great and rising and swelling as it came on it seemed a monster bearing down upon him for his destruction his eyes were strained intensely upon it and the thoughts passed his mind in rapid succession it is an island it is coming down to the right of me i shall just weather it that rocky point reaching out toward me will just trip me up i shall be dashed to pieces and at the same instant he swept by just clearing the rough and ragged ledge and running on with the speed of a rail car until the whole mass disappeared again in the mists and behind him this occurrence our of the necessity of a careful look out ahead to be dashed against a rocky shore or even against one that was not rocky at the speed at which he was going would have brought his adventures to a very sudden close and after all his means of guarding against such a danger were very slender he had no way of bringing up his craft very suddenly his only resource seemed to be to throw himself off upon the ice to his own motion by the of his clothes upon the surface and to let his fated vessel dash on he took out his knife and deliberately cut a hole in the sail that he might see what was before him it was necessary for him to sit of the sail both because there was not room for him before and also because it was necessary to bring the chief upon the pair of which were behind otherwise the ice boat would not keep her position in the line of the wind for to secure this it was necessary that the centre of resistance should be behind the centre of impulse as in an arrow the m midnight land the boat runs ashore is in the heavy head which leads while the chief resistance is in the end which follows having thus made an opening through the sail he kept up a careful watch and began to feel comparatively secure in the mean time the gale increased and m went on he passed islands and points of land and once or twice he found himself for some time gradually approaching land hut then either a change in the direction of the wind or a of the shore caused him to so as to gain a new he went on thus till midnight the falling of the snow increased also until the whole surface of the ice was covered with little wreaths which went along over the smooth surface by his side like clouds in a tempest he seemed to be running a race with them though light and airy as they were they all left him behind at length he saw a long shore at a considerable distance on the left he seemed to be going nearly parallel to it and yet it appeared after a time to be somewhat nearer to him perhaps the air was more clear so that he saw it more distinctly at least he hoped it was so he was however soon compelled to this hope he drew nearer and nearer he could distinguish the forms of the trees and hear very plainly the loud howling of the wind in their branches as the coast swept swiftly away behind him he could soon see the beach it was smooth and sandy and he was running at prodigious along it at the distance of a stone s throw and yet in such a direction that in a very short time he must inevitably run ashore he shrank back from the necessity as long as he could but finding a inevitable he carefully let himself down from his seat upon the ice and after sliding along a few rods came to rest his boat running up upon the shore at a short distance before him the ice boat m on his situation his native energy m concluded that he was now ten or fifteen miles from his place of departure but that was ten or fifteen miles too little if he had had any thing like a he could easily have laid his course off from this shore the wind being so nearly parallel to it but as it was his only me ns of getting again under way was to drag his out upon the ice away from the shore so as to get well to of it again he thought then that he might run several miles before he should again encounter it and it was not impossible that the coast might bear away to the left so as to enable him afterward to go ,22
not satisfied with it and after discussing the question for some time the boys concluded to go and refer it to and they both agreed to abide by his decision listened to the case very attentively at first both the boys began talking together each trying to get to decide in his favor but stopped them and made them talk one at a time â which is the said he the asked yes that is which is it claims something of the other i claim the picture said and i think it is mine added james which of you has got it now asked said james and you want him to give it to you yes answered james the title then you are the we always hear the s story first and afterwards the s am i the said yes said he makes a claim against you and you defend yourself from it so he is the and you are the accordingly let james tell the story and then he let say what he had to say in reply after they had both done speaking he reflected a moment and then said the amount of it is that you sold him an arrow stick and it afterwards turned out that your title was not good my title repeated not exactly understanding what meant by title yes that is your right to it the right which a man has to his property is called his title to it when he has not a good right we say his title is not good now the question seems to be this â if a man any thing to another man which was not really his and the real owner comes for it afterwards and takes it away from the man that bought it can he go to the man that sold it to him and demand his money back again the title yes said that is it exactly well now men said have two ways of selling things sometimes it is part of the agreement and bargain that the title is good and then if it afterwards turns out that it is not he has to pay back the money and sometimes the says he don t say whether his title is good or not he it as it is and lets the take the risk that is called a you see he and gives up all claim he has but does not warrant that somebody else may not have a claim for instance continued at the same time putting his hand into his pocket and taking out an old rusty there is a knife which i picked up in the road a good while ago and i don t know whose it is now you might offer me an apple for it and i might say i would give you a for the apple but not a that is i would give you all my right and title to it and then i never could take it back again but if the true owner should ever appear you would have to give it to him and you could not call upon me to give you back the title the apple because i only gave you a but then on the other hand if you had told me when i offered to sell you the knife that perhaps the real owner would appear and if i had said that i would run the risk of that and would warrant my title then if after that the real owner should appear and claim the knife you would have to give it up to him it is true but you could come back to me and demand the apple which you paid for it or something else equally valuable well said i did not warrant my title to the arrow stick no replied i suppose you did not say any thing about it whether you gave him a or a in selling houses and lands men are always very careful to state in the writings whether they give a or only a the writing is called a deed and so there are deeds and deeds if you buy a house and take a deed and afterwards some other man comes and proves that the house was his you can go to the man that sold it to you and get your money again but the if you only had a deed then you cannot get your money again then i should rather have a deed said certainly said every body would and now for your case in regard to property which is sold without any deed people generally say nothing about or but the law is that the is implied that is understood said yes said if you should go to a store and buy a and afterwards it should turn out that the did not belong to the but was only left there by somebody you could go and call upon the to pay you back the money unless he told you at the time that he was not sure the was his and that he would not warrant the title now did you tell james when you let him have the arrow stick that it was one which you found and that you only gave up your right and title to it no i did not said then said you in fact warrant the title ed your title and of course now you ought to give him back the picture perceived the justice of this decision and gave james his picture in his own mind that he never would warrant his title again unless he was sure it was a good one the boys were then turning away slowly to go back to their work when who had been standing very quietly by listening attentively and trying to understand what was said concluded that as the case went against he had better put ,22
henry climbed up to reach the are you sure will let us have it said henry o yes said besides i will ask him for it when i pass along through the yard henry reached down the while held the box and stood by looking on with an intent and earnest countenance the boys then put back the box and went out as they passed through the yard they saw standing at the great block at a little distance some called out to him and held up the as he passed along the ship question said he see raised his eyes from his work and aw that was carrying off his but he did not say any thing he looked at him a moment and then resumed his work and allowed the boys to pass on the boys went on through the garden but they stopped at the which led over the fence at the bottom of it thinking that that would be a good place to sit down and make the boat for the steps of the made convenient seats for them to sit upon so henry who was going to make the boat took his seat upon the middle step and sat below while remained at the top nearly on a level with the top of the fence where he could look down and inspect the whole op e henry took out his knife and began to fashion the boat he split off a piece of the from one side for a mast and he laid aside also a piece for the he cut out a sail of white paper and fastened it upon the mast then he made a deep into the middle of the boat with his and cutting the end of his mast into the shape of a he drove it in f the ship question when he first began to make his boat asked him if he would not give it to him when it was done and he said that he would afterwards as they were sitting there talking together while he was finishing the ship seemed very much pleased with it especially when he saw the fastened on and he told henry that if he would give it to him he would give him his whip this offer was a very tempting one to henry for he wanted that whip very much so he concluded to alter his mind about giving the boat to and to give it to instead in exchange for his whip no said that won t be fair you have already given the boat to me no said henry i did not really give it to you yes said i asked you if you would give it to me when it was done and you said yes i said perhaps i would replied henry no you said really replied no answered henry shaking his head very gravely as he was putting the mast into its place no i said perhaps i m very sure i said perhaps the ship question o henry exclaimed you did not say any thing about perhaps well i meant perhaps said henry i am sure f that here is your whip henry said and he put the whip over henry s neck so that the handle and the lash hung down be fore the handle on one side and the lash on the other he began to be afraid that there would be some dispute about the title to the boat and he was anxious to complete his part of his contract with henry by delivering the whip into his possession while he did this who sat on the step below took hold of the end of the boat which was towards him he did not pull it any but held it gently so as not to interfere much with henry s fixing the mast but only so that he should be all ready to take it as soon as it should be finished seeing this movement took hold of the other end of the boat and of the mast saying at the same time no it is my boat said no said i say it is mine henry had about finished his work and at the ship question any rate he could not do any thing more now while the boys were holding upon the boat so he let go and and began to pull against each other said said just at this moment the mast and the which were the parts of the boat which had hold of both came out of their places into s hands and finding that he had thus gained possession of a part of the property seemed disposed to make sure of this for he scrambled down the side of the which was towards the garden and ran along a few steps in one of the walks and then stopped and looked around to see if was following him give me my mast and said give me my boat said in reply i am going to tell of you sir said because you won t give me my things i am going to tell him of you said because you have got my boat it is boat for henry gave it to me f i so saying both the boys went along in it of went up through the while went around through the the ship question field henry followed slowly the whip and now and then snapping it as he walked along when they got into the yard was no where to be seen called out for him in a loud voice who seemed to wish that his cause should not suffer for want of any attention on his part to the requisite began to call for too in a minute the boys heard an answer coming from behind the barn so they all went around behind the barn they found there with a he ,22
head of water in it head of water repeated he did not know exactly what meant yes said head of water the perpendicular height of water raised by a dam they call the head i should think that you had eight or ten inches head father calls it column said column repeated ly in his turn yes said column was not quite right in this for his ther had not used the word column in the same sense and connection in which used his phrase however he forgot this apparent immediately for told him that he ought not to have left the in when he came away from the dam why not said because said if you had taken out the the water would have been let off through the holes and would not have risen so high we want it to rise high said water not when you are at home in bed nd asleep said will it do any said it puts your dam in danger said ht w why in two ways said in the first place the higher it rises h the wiu be about the under edge of the dâ and the greater the danger is that the will blow blow said what do you mean by blow â if it does a little we can stop it again by on more sand and gravel u find i rather think said tj on sand and gray el will not n h good in stopping a hole when you inches of water on did not understand all this very well but he asked what the other danger would be why the water now has no way of escape but over the top of the board for it must continue to run in until it fills the dam full and then the will run over the top now the water which runs over will fall down close to the under side of the board the of and will gradual y dig out a hole there aiid it may before to morrow morning the dam and let the water through then said i wish i had taken out the yes said that would have been safer however there is one advantage in leaving them in and letting the water run over what is that said why all the dirt and leaves c will be drawn off from the surface of the water and will run over the dam so that if the dam stands safe until morning the water will be clear and beautiful then said i ll let it stay as it is and take the risk said yes said miss mary will like to see it look clear and beautiful is she coming to give you another lecture said yes said i hope she will well said and to morrow evening ni come and give you a lecture o said laughing you give a ic why said o because said miss mary in a teacher so am i said at any rate h you will get james to come and help you make an audience you may see if i lecture â weu said â we ue what was thinking of when he was looking over the bridge how he going to ascertain whether the of the water was level did he find that there was any current is a pond generally perfectly level how did s father show that a pond would generally have a descent what is a column how is the pressure of water upon any part of the bottom of a vessel measured how is the calculation made when the part is upon the side of the vessel what peculiar expression did use when he was speaking of s dam what did he mean by it did he think that the dam was perfectly what two dangers did he think it exposed to chapter viii blowing had another lecture from miss before he had an opportunity to listen to s performance the appointment for this second lecture of miss mary s was made in a somewhat singular way as follows â the morning after the conversation with on the in the bam rose early to go down before breakfast and see if his dam had been carried away to his great joy he foimd it all safe the water too was beautifully clear and transparent and it extended in a smooth and sheet for a considerable distance up between the banks of the brook a thin sheet of water was gliding over the edge of the board and falling down into a little basin which it had itself made in the sand below thence it off down the bed of the brook and as far down as could see the little il water â appeared to flow quietly along just rs if no dam had been built j ist at this moment s eye caught s white upon the top of one of the which had driven down behind the board to support it in its place it was a piece of paper folded once a small stone from the brook was laid upon it to keep it from being blown away took the stone ofl and found his own name written upon he back of the paper he opened it and n i as follows â in taking my morning walk i came down to ee your dam how beautiful and clear the water looks i shall take a walk again afternoon at five o clock and if you and j will be here i will come and give you a lecture miss was very much pleased to receive this note i wish said he to himself that i had known that miss mary was coming here so for then i would have come down too and so i should have been here with her no i don t either said he for then i should not have had this note ,22
gradually gave place to a more sober and thoughtful air which represented far more correctly the state of the heart within â a state of utter desolation his mode of talking too changed its character entirely from the light and trifling tone of merriment and jest which he had assumed at first it changed to a serious and even melancholy expression m gradually led the conversation to serious subjects and the uttered many complaints of the trials and troubles of life the selfishness and hard of men and the hard struggles and disappointments and sorrows which we have to encounter all along on the weary journey these topics brought out again progress of the voyage half way rock m s reflections the old man s feelings very strongly dissatisfaction with the world resentment at his own read or supposed ill treat ment and a very vivid sense of the injustice the selfishness and the wickedness of men in general seemed to he his prominent feelings and he expressed them very freely m the along the party in the talking on the above and on many other subjects in a very good natured and pleasant manner for several miles at length as they were gliding along a smooth sandy beach which at this part of the pond formed the shore m saw before him a rocky which was familiar to him as a being the half way rock between his little farm and the fell s point to which he was bound on this he knew that the place of their destination would come into view and the sight reminded him that the time was approaching when he should take leave of his passengers perhaps never to see them again he perceived that they were both in all probability living entirely without god and he felt a strong desire to do something to bring their souls to the peace and happiness which his own had found what shall i do or say thought he how can reach such hearts how evident it is that i can do nothing i can tell them what they ought to do but who shall give them hearts to do it i shall only awaken their anger by urging them to repent of their sins and return to god will perhaps conceal his displeasure though he will feel it as strongly but then as to the old man he will as likely as not break out upon me in open fury it is useless to make the attempt so saying m on a few strokes farther he reflected how lost and hopeless his condition had been and yet that god had had mercy upon him why may he not he added have mercy upon these h m gives the conversation a religious he reflected moreover that it was not his duty to save them but only to try to save them his part was to bring obvious religious truths to bear upon them but it was for god to give it if therefore he added i do what i can i shall then feel satisfied that my duty is done and shall rest to night peaceful and happy leaving the re in the hands of god accordingly after a silent prayer to god to give him right motives and feelings and to aid him in his thoughts and words he commenced conversation anew by asking the old man if he had heard a certain celebrated preacher who had been through that part of the country and a good deal of attention no and never will if i can help it was the reply perhaps he isn t of your persuasion persuasion he answered i have no persuasion i don t belong to any of your my creed is a very short one â let a man do his duty well here and he need not fear any trouble hereafter i am very easy on that score that is true no doubt said m but suppose a man does not do his duty why then he ought to expect to suffer for it in another world asked m i don t know about another world said the old man i ve never been there and he laughed laboriously but not very heartily at his joke m felt discouraged but reflecting that the responsibility resting upon him was not an obligation to succeed in bringing the sinner to repentance but only to discharge his own duty in giving him a warning he determined to pursue the conversation at least a little farther while he was pausing the old man moving upon his seat said no they tell about a change of heart and such non again the law of god the stranger s ideas of religious duty sense but my bible tells me that to do justly and love mercy is religion and if a man will do that he has nothing to fear do justly love mercy and walk humbly with god j i believe it is said m mildly like enough said the old man and a man must keep this command all the time why yes i suppose so replied the old man certainly added m by way of establishing the point because you see it won t do for a man to be just and merciful a part of the time and unjust and cruel the other part that would be no way to deserve heaven the old man did not answer but he lay quietly in his place gazing up at the clouds with an air of assumed indifference and then walking humbly with god is a part of the rule added m d i am no friend to said the old man after a short pause no i presume not but that is the rule if we wish to fit ourselves for heaven we must do justly love mercy and walk humbly with god all our days from childhood to old age ,22

the first book we come across in the wilderness of books is to learn nothing to turn over the pages of ten thousand volumes is to be practically indifferent to all that is good and john offers the following advice to it is of the greatest importance to you not only for art s sake but review j on the choice of books for all kinds of sake in these of book to keep out of the salt of literature and live on a httle rocky island of own with a spring and a lake in it pure and good i cannot of course suggest the choice of your library to you for every several mind needs different books but there are some books which we all need and assuredly if you read shakespeare and as much as you ought you will not require wide of your shelves to right and left of them for purposes of perpetual study among modem books avoid generally magazine and review literature sometimes it may contain a useful or a wholesome piece of criticism but the chances are ten to one it will either waste your time or you if you want to understand any subject whatever read the best book upon it you can hear of not a review of the book a common book will often give you much amusement but it is only a noble book which will give you dear friends the book lover if any of us could recall the time which we have spent in and reading and devote it now faithfully to the of that special line of study which ought ago to have been chosen how largely we might add to our fund of useful knowledge and how we might increase our intellectual stature if i could recover the hours idly given to the newspaper not for my own gratification but solely for my neighbor at the breakfast table says a contemporary critic i could compass a solid course of english and american history get at the of political parties in the two countries and give the reasons for the existence of and of and in modem politics â and there is undoubtedly a reason for them all two columns a day in the newspapers â which i could easily have spared for they were given mainly to murder trials and the search for or to the romance of the concerning the same â have during the last ten years absorbed just about the on the choice of books time i might have spent in reading a very respectable course in history â one embracing say and for greece and for rome and green for my roots in and for the tree in america together with a very notable excursion into spain and holland with and â a course which i consider very desirable and one which should set up a man of middle age very fairly in historical knowledge i am sure i could have saved this amount out of any ten years of my newspaper reading alone without cutting off any portion of that really valuable contribution for which the daily paper is to be honored and which would be needed to make me

up and i stripped myself and in when i was about three hundred feet from the boat the water suddenly became deep and i had to swim i caught hold of the stem of the boat and hung on to it until the ships came up the threw me the end of a strong cord i passed this through a hole in the of the boat and made it fast the other end was fastened to one of the ships but such a cord would be of little use in so heavy a boat with great labor therefore i swam towards the land pushing the boat before me when at last my feet touched the bottom and the water came only to my i stopped nine other were thrown out to me by the these i fastened to the boat s in the same manner as the first each of these was fastened to a separate ship the wind was now towards the shore the ten little ships spread their sails the great boat floated slowly behind them in a short time we reached the shallow beach and the boat upon the sand i waited until the tide began to go out th with the help of two thousand men with ropes and i managed to turn the boat right side up it floated i the water out of it and it to a big rock on the shore the emperor s ships returned into port and the news of what the man mountain had done was carried to every part of the country i worked ten days at making me some oars you may guess how hard a time i had of it for the largest tree in was not big enough to make one oar of the proper length when i had finished them i embarked in the boat and it around into the bay nearest the city how great was the wonder of the people to behold so big a vessel they came from every part of the island to see it how the king of was disappointed i told the emperor that my good fortune had sent me this boat i told him that it would carry me to some place whence i could return to my own country would he kindly give me leave to sail aw ay in it he answered me in a very pretty little speech he told mc how sorry he was to lose so kind a friend who had done so much for the good of his country yet he knew how i must long to see my own people and my own again and therefore he would not hinder me he hoped i would have a pleasant voyage i thanked him and went about getting ready for my departure now the of had not yet learned why i had left his country he supposed that i still thought him friendly to me and that i was just paying the emperor of a short visit but when he found that i was staying so long he became uneasy it is time that the man mountain was taking his medicine he said his visit to our neighbors has already lasted too long he must return so he sent one of his officers to tell the emperor of how i had been disgraced and how my punishment was already due the officer explained how very merciful the king had been in allowing me to live and to keep everything but my eyes indeed he said the man mountain should be very grateful that his life has been spared and then in the name of the king he demanded that i should be bound hand and foot and sent back to to be punished as a traitor will not the emperor of see to this the peace and friendship of the two countries will depend upon his course in this matter l the emperor took three days to think the matter over then he made answer with many civil excuses he said that as for binding me hand and foot his brother the king knew it could not be done he said that although i had taken his fleet yet he was grateful to me for the many kind services i had done him in making peace between the two countries but he added you shall soon be made happy for the man mountain has found a big vessel on the shore that will carry him far over the sea in a few weeks both and will be free from so great a burden and danger with this answer the messenger went back to the emperor then told me all that had happened if it pleases you to stay in he said i will see that no harm comes to you you are welcome to remain with us as long as you choose i thanked him and begged that he would excuse me i said that since i now had a vessel of my own it would be better for me to seek my own country how i sailed from the land of little people the emperor did not seem to be displeased in fact i was afterwards told that he was very glad to be rid of me the work on my boat was hurried forward five hundred workmen were busy with the sails these they made by thirteen folds of their strongest linen together i made the ropes and myself by twisting twenty or thirty of their strongest ropes together a great stone that i found by the served very well for an anchor the of three hundred cows was given me for the boat and for other uses in about a month the work was finished and i was ready to take my leave the emperor and his family came out of the palace to bid me good bye i lay down on my face to kiss their hands which ,23
region east of the and about the head waters of the there was no attempt at settlement the fear of the prevented priest and alike from upon these great hunting grounds of the red man ii the it is interesting to learn how the french people in the country lived in friendship with the savage tribes around them the were usually small villages on the edge of a or in the heart of the woods they were always near the bank of a river for the water courses were the only roads and the light of the were the only means of travel there the french lived like one large family having for their rulers the village priest and the older men of the community the houses were built along a single narrow street and so close together that the villagers could carry on their gossip each from his own these houses were made of a rude of corner posts the and cross ties and were outside and in with cat and clay â a kind of mortar made of mud and mixed with straw and moss around each house was a fence and the form of the and gardens was regulated by the village adjoining the village was a large or common field for the free use of all the villagers the size of this field depended upon the number of families in the settlement it sometimes contained several hundred acres it was divided into plots or one for each household and the size of the plot was to the number of persons in the family each household attended to the cultivation of its own ground and gathered its own harvest and if any one should neglect to care for his plot and let it become overgrown with weeds and he his right to any part of the common field and his ground was given to another surrounding the common field was a large tract of cleared land that was used as a common pasture ground in some cases there were thousands of acres in this tract and yet no person was allowed to use any part of it except for the of his stock when a new family came into the settlement or a newly married couple began housekeeping a small part of the pasture ground was taken into the common field in order to give the new household its proper the priest occupied the place of father to all the villagers whether white or red they confided all their troubles to him he was their in matters of learning as well as of religion they obeyed his word as law old â french life in the the great business of all was fur trading and the care of their little plots of ground the women kept their homes in order tended their gardens and helped with the and the the men were the of the community some were soldiers some were but most were engaged in hunting and in gathering skins and hides to be sold to the and finally sent to europe the kept a small stock of french goods ribbons and other articles useful and ornamental and these they exchanged for the of

among the sources of the and others took to the forest as woods or and became almost as wild as the indians themselves they wandered wherever their fancy led them hunting game and trading with their dusky friends those who in the lake regions built here and there small of logs and surrounded them with in one of these a company of two or three would remain for a few weeks and then leave it to be occupied by any one who might next come that way a post of this kind was built at long before any permanent settlement was made there and scattered long distances apart on the lake shore and in the heart of the wilderness were many others the the northern when returning from the woods resorted to as their or loaded with skins they made their way to where they conducted themselves in a manner that would have a or a but the of the country were in the habit of returning once each year to their village homes there they were welcomed with joy balls and were given in their honor and old and young gathered around them to hear the story of their adventures thus in the heart of the wilderness these french passed their lives in the enjoyment of unbounded freedom they delighted in amusements and there were almost as many holidays as working days being a thousand miles from any of civilization they knew but little of what was taking place in the world in their hearts they were devoted to their mother country they believed that france ruled the world and therefore all must be right further than this they troubled themselves but little they were contented and happy and seldom allowed themselves to be annoyed by the cares of business they had no wish to subdue the wilderness to down the forest and make farms and build roads and bring civilization to their doors to do this would be to change the modes of living that were so dear to them it would destroy the fur trade and then what would become of the the and the de these french were not the kind of people to found colonies and

only one of his but that no pious person who perfectly understood the scheme could hear him four or five times without being struck with his abilities as a minister of the gospel mr was in many instances some of which have been mentioned to me in the minds of ministers of the gospel back to the paths of truths firom which they had wandered his own notions of the scheme were at all times remarkably clear and he possessed a great in pointing out and triumphantly the errors into which pious of the gospel with whom he was personally acquainted had he occasionally referred to cases of this kind in his own quaint homely way speaking of one whom he conceived to have for entertained views on one of the leading doctrines of the gospel but who had been led the rev william partly through his to re embrace his first opinions on the subject mr was sometimes known to say â ah i poor jack has been a great wanderer in his time but we have got him back at last to the right i know one minister who is still alive whose views some change respecting the perfect co equality of the father the son and the holy spirit and with whom mr had many an anxious discussion in private on the subject in the hope of bringing him back to the creed which he had eventually the reverend gentleman to whom i allude was led to his former sentiments respecting the and became and now is one of the and most zealous of the very article of faith which for several years he to destroy what influence mr may have had in bringing about the latter change i am not in a condition to say i may however take this opportunity of mentioning that the doctrine which was questioned or rather denied namely the entire eternal equality of the three persons in the the rev william waa one to which he assigned a peculiar in his public but let me also remark as the ct may prove a useful hint to other ministers who may have or may be now in the matter that mr while dwelling on th â proper deity of the son and the agency of the holy ghost delighted to on the doctrine of christ s humanity he often said and i think with much truth that this doctrine is in a great measure kept in the back ground by some of the most of our ministers or that at all events it is not brought forward in that marked manner in which it ought to be he dwelt on it with a sort of because he regarded it as one of the most blessed truths in the bible that in virtue of his humanity should enter tain the most cordial sympathy for and should have a perfect fellow feeling with his suffering people mr was exceedingly attached to his congregation it was with the greatest reluctance that he ever agreed to preach in any the william other chapel than his own and in very few cases was he ever prevailed on to do so neither could he be induced except in very peculiar circumstances to allow any other clergyman to occupy his pulpit his people were ever uppermost in his thoughts they were in one sense a part of his spiritual being it can hardly be necessary to add that his consequent influence over them was great he was so well aware of this that when he preached a sermon for any charitable purpose instead of dwelling on the of the charity or the claims it had on them as men and as christians â a thing which he much disliked as he conceived that pulpit should almost if not altogether be exclusively confined to men s in reference to their prospects for eternity â he would sometimes content himself with two or three sentences relative to the money part of the affair these sentences were as ingenious as they were quaint and plainly spoken i have he would say pledged my word to the secretary of the institution in favour of whose funds we are now about to make a collection that the william you would contribute the sum of sixty pounds do not make me a i need not say that such an appeal from such a man as william made to such a congregation as his always proved as successful as if he had spent half an hour in urging on them the claims which the particular charity had on their support in connection with the homely or rather harsh term which i have given in as having been employed by mr on the occasions in question i may mention that he was in the habit of using other equally harsh in reference to ing to the treachery of his heart or the operations of in dwelling corruption he would often say that he looked on william as the greatest scoundrel on the of the earth he was thus as singular in his as he was eccentric in his conduct li private conversation he appeared to great disadvantage except when the subject was one or it might be fifty pounds or forty according to circumstances f the which happened at the time to press on his in that case he would display powers as to render it quite a treat to listen to him on other occasions he could scarcely utter a word and often looked and acted as if under some slight temporary of on one occasion two gentlemen of great piety and large wealth after hearing him for several successive were so struck with the vigour the brilliancy and of his mind as to regard him as the greatest man they had ever met with they were consequently exceedingly anxious to meet with him in private not doubting but they would enjoy an intellectual as well ,24

the and kindness which exist among them form a striking contrast to the state of matters in this respect among the of mr the history and of chapter third the doctrines of the brethren i come now to the question of doctrine in connection with the brethren i shall no doubt be asked in the outset are there any differences between the and divisions and if so what are they it is easier to answer the first question and to say that there are differences than it is to answer the second and say what they are on either side no number of and tracts have been published but there is much obscurity as to views in most of them while even those authors writing on the same side are often at with each other and not each is found to be at with himself it is right however to say that there is much more error in the section of the brethren than of the section the latter are so far as i can ascertain essentially sound in relation to all the good saving and doctrines of the gospel one important doctrine on which the two parties differ is that of the of christ the reject that doctrine as having no foundation in scripture the party regard it as one of the most important doctrines in the word of god and hold it to be as clearly revealed as any doctrine within the whole compass of the bible it accordingly a prominent place in their the give perhaps greater to the doctrine of union by faith in a risen christ than to any other doctrine within the circle of the christian scheme the section of the brethren are as firm in the indispensable necessity of faith in the of christ in order to salvation as the other party but they do not place it so much in the as almost to hide from view the doctrine of the cross the in most of the or as some of their number prefer the word derived from the phrase not the of yourselves together there are some who have individual opinions on several points different from those of the body generally but as a body they hold the class of opinions usually with regard to the duty of all in christ to possess in abiding and rich abundance the assurance of faith they are quite in accordance with the party so they are on the question of the personal reign of christ on earth during the state they are no less at one in the belief that the who is to the second advent of our lord when he comes to his personal reign will be not a system but a personal who will last for three years and a half that being days and rot for years as prophetic writers almost without exception expected for the last two centuries and a half would be the period of s on the earth of course with their views of a personal christ they do not believe that has already come but as it is with the party of the brethren that i shall hereafter have chiefly to do it will be as well here to repeat what i have stated in my preface that when i afterwards employ the word brethren or the phrase brethren i refer only to the section of that body this will prevent the reader from the two parties there is a marked distinction of a practical kind between the two sections of the brethren there is scarcely anything deserving the name of among the division whereas among the party there is a considerable amount i ought however to mention that the feeling and practice are much more among those who are simply with that party in heart than among those who are in open communion with them probably are few more devoted in the present day than lord and those who know his personally are well aware that his warmest sympathies are entirely with the party but he has not joined them in the sense of formal fellowship i ought however to add that he is frequently present at their prayer meetings their a the history and of meetings for the of the and that he often breaks bread with them i could name several other of high social position who in their hearts are one with the section of the brethren although they have not openly united with them but deem it their duty still to remain in communion with the church of england but while a considerable amount of is done by members of the party chiefly by those who in heart and soul though not belong to them â i am not acquainted with any belonging to the section of the brethren who are remarkably noted for their labours it is right however i should say that i am assured by those who ought to know that a large number of them are devoted but i now come to the consideration of what is to be the principal subject of this chapter â the doctrine of the party â understanding the doctrine in the higher of the word first of all then let us look at the question of our lord s humanity as understood by mr and his when to the charges preferred by mr against mr of the latter having held the doctrine of the of our lord s humanity i made a passing remark to the effect that mr appears to have actually adopted the same views as those with which he seems to have been absolutely when assuming and asserting that they were entertained by mr mr groves a man of the highest character and who has no intimacy with or towards mr in any way goes fully into this point in the to which i have already referred but says mr groves a few years have passed away and ,24

innumerable were in all parts of the country in the hope of of one impression nearly copies were forwarded to the leading towns throughout the kingdom still the thing did not take the circulation never exceeded a few hundreds it lingered for six months and then made its exit a large sum of money was lost by the speculation the other of any popularity the mirror the penny magazine and the saturday magazine the has been fifteen or sixteen years in existence it is the property of mr well known for his popular edition of the works of the most celebrated mr is also understood to be the editor of the mirror the circulation of this was at one time very great i have heard it stated and i have no reason to question the ae of the statement at copies it certainly was to be seen everywhere it was popular but not more so than it d served for it has always been conducted taste lord when paid it l h in his place in die house of nine or ten years ago the great number of conducted on a

under which it has had to the has been gradually its lost si i do not know what i the present amount of its sale but i know it is very considerable the work consists partly of and partly of original

commencement has been altogether in the history of literature either in this or any other country for some time its weekly circulation on copies within the last two years it has fallen oflf considerably but is still very great even now i am given to understand it is not much less than the name of the society under whose it was ushered into the world and whose sanction it still receives was doubtless a very powerful recommendation to it in the minds of most men but the judgment displayed in its selected matter and the care with which its original articles were prepared on its first appearance â and it possesses the same merits still â could not fail to attract attention especially when published at the previously unheard of price of one penny then there were its at once ous and

mr he said as soon as he could speak you are just dead right about that s the place of places for me salary and nothing to do oh how rd love it i the rest of the breakfast was eaten in silence the spring chickens were too good and too plentiful to admit of much waste of time in conversation at the conclusion of the meal the idiot rose from the table and after again mr and his e announced that he was going to see his employer on sunday mrs yes i want him to write me a recommendation as a man who can do nothing beautifully and why pray asked mr i m going to apply to the of college the first thing to morrow morning for an for if anybody can do nothing and draw money for it gracefully i m the man wall street by ic is too wearing on my nerves and i m going to leave it he replied and in a moment he was gone i like him said mrs so do i said mr he isn t half the idiot he thinks he is by ic by ic the idiot by ic by ic to william k by ic by ic the idiot some weeks after the happy event which transformed the popular mrs into the charming mrs john all went well at that lady s select home for single gentlemen it was only proper that during the honey moon at least of the happy couple between the idiot and his fellow should cease it was expecting too much of mankind however to look for a continued and the morning arrived when nature once more herself and trouble began just what it was that prompted the remark no one knows but it happened that the idiot did say that he thought that after all life on a canal boat had its advantages mr who had come into the dining room in a slightly irritable frame of mind induced perhaps by mr by ic s that as he was now part proprietor of the house he should be a little more prompt in making his towards its maintenance chose to take the remark as a reflection upon the way things were managed in the household i he said i had hoped that your habit of your views had been put aside for once and for all very absurd hope my dear sir observed the idiot views that are not become why shouldn t i give them an opportunity once in a while because they are the sort of views to which is the most appropriate end snapped the school master any man who as you have asserted that life on a canal boat has its advantages ought to go further and prove his sincerity by living on one i can t afford it said the idiot meekly it isn t cheap by any manner of means in the first place you can t live happily on a canal boat unless you can afford to keep horses in fact canal boat life is a combination of the most expensive luxuries since it and driving with nevertheless if you will put your by ic mind on it you will find that with a for your home you can do a great many things that you can t do with a house i decline to put my mind on a said mr sharply passing his coffee back to mrs for another lump of sugar thereby to that good lady s discomfiture since before their marriage the mere fact that the had been poured by her fair hand had given it all the sweetness it needed or at least that was what the school master had said and more than once at that tou are under no obligation to do so the idiot returned though if i had a mind like yours put it on a canal boat and have it away somewhere out of sight these other gentlemen however i think will agree with me when i say that the mere fact that a canal boat can be moved about the country and is in no sense a anywhere shows that as a dwelling place it is superior to a house take this house for instance this neighborhood used to be the best in town it is still far from being the worst neighborhood in town but it is as it has been for several years the establishment of a bath on one comer and a by ic store on the other has taken away of that air of refinement which it when the block was devoted to purposes entirely now just suppose for a moment that this street were a canal and that this house were a canal boat the canal could run down as much as it pleased the neighborhood could but it could not affect the value of this house as the home of refined people as long as it was possible to up a team of horses to the front stoop and tow it into a better locality i d like to every man at this table that mrs wouldn t take five minutes to make up her mind to tow this house up to a spot near central park if it were a canal boat and the streets were water instead of a mixture of water sand and blocks no said the ejaculated mr you seem to lose sight of another fact said the idiot warming up to his subject if man had had the sense in the beginning to adopt the canal boat system of life and we were used to that sort of thing it would not be so hard upon us in summer time when we have to live in hotels in order that we and our families may reap the benefits of a period by ic the nuisance of to pat by ic by ic in ,27

chance situations without making much impression on the general forest continuing up through the two pines in the same scattered growth it begins to show its character and at an elevation of about

of the seeds of a new species of pine which he learned were obtained from a veiy large tree far to the southward of the at the end of the next summer returning to fort after the setting in of the winter rains bearing in mind the big pine he had heard of he set out on an excursion up the valley in search of it and how he and what dangers and hardships he endured are best told in his own journal from which i quote as follows october weather dull cold and cloudy when my friends in england are made acquainted with my travels i fear they will think i have told them nothing but my miseries i quitted my camp early in the morning to survey the neighboring country leaving my guide to take charge of the horses until my return in the evening about an hour s walk from the camp i met an indian who on perceiving me instantly strung his bow the mountains of placed on his left arm a sleeve of skin and stood on the being quite sure that conduct was prompted by fear and not by hostile intentions the poor fellow having probably never seen such a being as myself before i laid my gun at my feet on the ground and waved my hand for him to come to me which he did slowly and with great caution i then made him place his bow and quiver of arrows beside my gun and striking a light gave him a smoke out of my own pipe and a present of a few beads with my pencil i made a rough sketch of the and pine tree which i wanted to obtain and drew his attention to it when he instantly pointed with his hand to the hills fifteen or twenty miles distant towards the south and when i expressed my intention of going thither cheerfully set out to accompany me at midday i reached my long wished f or pines and lost no time in examining them and to collect specimens and seeds new and strange things seldom fail to make strong impressions and ai e therefore frequently over j so that lest i should never see my friends in england to inform them of this most beautiful and immensely grand tree i shall here state the dimensions of the largest i could find among several that had been blown down by the wind at feet from the ground its is feet inches at feet feet inches the extreme length feet as it was impossible either to climb the tree or it down i endeavored to knock off the by at them ball when the report of my gun brought eight indians all of them painted with red earth armed with bows arrows bone tipped and they appeared anything but friendly i explained to them what i wanted and they seemed satisfied and sat down to smoke but presently i saw one of them string his bow and another his flint knife with a pair of wooden and it on the wrist of his right hand ther testimony of their intentions was the forests to save myself by flight was impossible so without hesitation i stepped back about five paces cocked my gun drew one of the pistols out of my belt and holding it in my left hand and the gun in my right showed myself determined to fight for my life as much as possible i endeavored to preserve my coolness and thus we stood looking at one another without making any movement or uttering a word for perhaps ten minutes when one at last who seemed to be the leader gave a sign that they wished for some tobacco this i signified that they should have if they fetched a quantity of they went off immediately in search of them and no sooner were they all out of sight than i picked up my three and some twigs of the trees and made the possible retreat hurrying back to the camp which i reached before dusk i now write lying on the grass with my gun cocked beside me and these lines by the light of my candle namely an piece of wood this grand pine discovered under such exciting circumstances named in honor of his friend dr of london the trunk is a smooth round delicately

extending far back into the snowy recesses of its fountains made a magnificent display of its wealth and i was strongly tempted to go and explore it at all but winter had come and the of its was an obstacle i had therefore to be content for the present with and studying its main features at a distance when we arrived at the hunting camp men women and children came out to welcome us in the

occupied the bay halted here for some time and deposited this island material as a that more of the bay was not filled in shows that after lingering here it comparatively fast all the level portions of trunks of occupying ocean instead of melting back gradually in times of general shrinking and as inland with sloping channels do melt almost uniformly over all the surface until they become thin enough to float then of course with each rise and fall of the tide the sea water with a temperature usually considerably above the point rushes in and out beneath them causing rapid waste of the surface while the upper is being wasted by the weather until at length the portions of these great become comparatively thin and weak and are broken up and vanish almost simultaneously bay is

otherwise from the paths family portraits worn across it in the frequent travel of a low country but although her life has been somewhat by such my cousin is too spirited a woman to give up to them

â the feelings of his own breast â â â â â he never in conversation or debate mentioned a hero a worthy or a feet in greek or roman history but so vaguely and loosely as to leave room to back out if

following william to thomas october sir i now submit to you the last sheets of my sketches of mr henry which i am sorry to find more numerous than i expected and i pray you to forgive the great trouble which i am sincerely ashamed of having imposed on you your remarks have been of great service to me not only by me to correct mistakes in but by putting me on a severe of my style which i am perfectly aware is too prone to i am afraid that the whole plan is too loose and the narrative too has it struck you in this light and do you think it would gain in point of animation and interest by and there were other of minor errors suggested in this letter which are the biography of henry â i have another question to ask to which i entreat an answer and i hope you think too well of my understanding to sup pose that i shall be hurt by the answer whatever it may be would you as a friend advise me to publish this book or not f it has been written under circumstances so extremely amid such perpetual arising from my profession â at almost every step too â and i it myself with so little satisfaction that i am seriously apprehensive it may make of what little reputation i possess as a

made a very free use of your communications it was natural for me to seek to give this value to my work but it would be most to me to be in any manner in you to the renewed attacks of your political enemies it is not enough for me that you despise these attacks i have no right much less have i the disposition to make this call upon your fortitude and besides the shaft which cannot reach you never fails to wound and your friends this was one of the leading causes which made me anxious to submit my manuscript to you â have i not quoted some passages from you of which the descendants of our landed aristocracy may take it into their heads to complain this did not occur to me till mr william h than whom you have not a warmer friend made the suggestion i have great dependence on his judgment and if the matter occurs to you in the same light i will send up again the sheets which contain those and get the favour of you to alter them to your own taste you will perceive that i have

twelve o clock breakfast richard â awaiting her coming beneath the dome of the airy set in the angle of the wall of the high lying garden â had time to become conscious of slight irritation it was not merely that he was impatient of delay but that his nerves were on edge just now trifles had power to his somewhat but when at length emerged from the house irritation was forgotten moving through the vivid lights and shadows of the and grove her appearance had a charm of unwonted simplicity at first sight her graceful person had the effect of being clothed in a religious habit richard s youthful delight in seeing a woman walk beautifully remained to him it received satisfaction now advanced without haste a certain grandeur in her a certain gloom even as one who takes serious counsel of himself indifferent to external things at once actor in and spectator of some drama playing itself out in the theatre of his own soul and this effect of dignity of self recollection was curiously heightened by her dress â of a very soft and fine material of white the lines of it at once flowing and while as head gear in place of some startling construction of contemporary she wore after s progress the modest italian fashion a black lace over her bright hair arrived she greeted richard and without apology for delay accepted the contents of the first dish offered to her by the waiting men servants ate as though and putting a force upon herself and â that which was unusual with her before drank wine and watching her involuntarily richard s thought travelled back to a certain luncheon party at by the presence of genial puzzle headed lord and members of his numerous family when had swept in even as now had been self absorbed even as now of the drive to all in the sad november afternoon following on that luncheon he also thought of communications made by during that drive and of the long course of event and action directly or indirectly consequent on those he thought of the fog too and almost choking him when in the early morning driven by still virgin in body as in heart he had ridden out into a blank and world hoping the chill of it would the fever in his blood and of the fog again in the afternoon from out which the branches of the great trees like famine stricken arms in tattered seemed to pluck at the carriage as he walked the smoking horses up and down the drive waiting for to him and now somehow that fog seemed to come up between him and the well covered breakfast table between him and the radiant expanse of the capricious half classic half modern city outstretched there breeding in the heat of the sun the chill of the fog struck cold into his giving him the strangest physical sensation richard straightened himself in his chair passed his hands across his eyes impatiently and all the old life of it was a subject of which he forbade himself remembrance he had himself from all that cut himself adrift from it long ago by an act of will he tried to put it out of his mind now but the fog remained â an actual of his physical vision all he looked upon it was horribly uncomfortable he wished he was alone then he might have slipped down from his chair and according to his poor capacity of sought relief in movement meanwhile silently mechanically de continued her breakfast and as she so continued in addition to his singular physical sensations of vision and clinging chill he became aware of a growing embarrassment and sir richard between himself and his companion so far his and her intercourse had been easy and spontaneous because superficial since that first interview on the terrace a agreement had existed to avoid the personal note now for cause unknown that intercourse threatened entering upon a new phase it was as though the the which he observed in her and of which he was sensible in himself must of necessity in some some act â almost involuntary â of self revelation this silence and restraint seemed to richard charged with consequences which in his present condition of he was powerless to prevent and this displeased him mastery of surrounding influences being very dear to him at last coffee

veiled upon the fair and glittering prospect richard saw her face in the black draped her shoulders and bust with a certain of effect it was evident that â by something â she had been stirred to the of her vivacity and desire to shine and richard for all his coolness of head and rather cynical maturity of outlook had a restless suspicion of going forth â even as on that morning at â into a blank and world full of possibility where the safe way was difficult of discovery and where dangers might to his discomfort he spoke a little at random you must forgive me for being such an bad host he said

of the church with its half seen pictures and down below yes let excited and and other energetic improving and virtuous persons say what they may â it is very good at times to get away into silence and solitude to get away from all the noise and struggle of man with his arts and and magnificent schemes so often and his poor little space of anxious self conscious years and his mixed motives and feverish efforts to get away beyond all histories with their sounds of wailing and battle their of sin and of blood beyond all the with their vain attempts to square the circle and reconcile that which can never be reconciled beyond all the and all the with their bitter their arbitrary and j beyond yes beyond the very sense of right and wrong itself back back to the great serene heart of nature â a heart beating with and energy yet calm and restrained filled with the rapture and repose of power and victorious it is good to get back and lie on the warm bosom of the eternal mother the folds cf whose garments are the high mountains whose feet are set in the laughing ocean and whose life is the life of the world â to lie there while the soul slips away from the sense of its own paltry joys and sorrows from the narrow hopes and fears of the individual lot to be made one with the glorious order of created things the flesh and spirit no longer conscious of weary and divisions to dream of the everlasting mysteries of birth and growth and of the fulness of strength and of the failing of strength and of decay â and of the mystery of force of life again returning out of death to begin once more the ceaseless round of existence anew to dream of the mystery of night and morning summer and winter seed time and harvest rain and shine while through all the countless ages the

the pine trees in the afternoon sunshine had a perception of unspeakable trust and confidence of belief in a final reconciliation far away far off out of mortal sight for a little space he dimly grasped the strange secret of the â that state of lover and mistress and without movement without desire which in the estimation of some of the purest spirits the highest conception of perfect and enduring bliss thank god for this beautiful world he said to himself quietly and reverently the sun was sloping towards the west and the shadows were growing long when he rose up at last voices of the making their way back from the village church came up on the sea breeze from the winding paths below the spell indeed was broken but the impression it had made remained for a while yet philip wandered down towards the amazed filled with a solemn gladness â like a man who has seen a vision and spoken face to face with the gods but alas i these happy moments of clear insight and illumination are but moments after all the of our and artificial life soon drown the music of the the fair i ce of heaven is too soon obscured again by storms of passion while jealousy self will hatred and fear like evil beasts root up and the fruitful land man never in one stay â which is after all extremely fortunate for the and writer of fiction let us console ourselves â for indeed life at this admirably ideal level would interfere with our excellent system of large profits and quick returns colonel as he among the thought that perhaps he would not go up to the villa at all that evening the silent hour on the mountain side had done much to the chain of habit that was on him he was aware of a sudden sense of from the life of the villa â from mrs pierce with her sad secret and dark beauty from with his soft voice and air of a mild he had drunk deep of the cup of nature he could hardly go straight back and drink then thin and listen to the social gossip of a lady who was more than half in love with a gentleman of rather shady who on his part was greatly disposed to her step daughter the good colonel you see permitted himself to state the case a trifle just then and the contrast it offered to his late emotions was too glaring he paused with a slight movement of disgust he leaned against the grey trunk of one of the old and felt for his cigar case he had been a good deal moved a smoke would steady him decidedly he muttered i am not quite in the humour for those people just now yet in saying this the colonel was conscious of making a en s mental â those people did not include somehow he thought with a sense of relief of the bright glancing looks and laughter she was as fresh and natural and far from all subtle of sinister meaning as the scent of the pine trees or the and glitter of the mountain streams she would understand it all well enough he thought his clear eyes softened and he smiled quietly to himself she would never strike a false note or be out of tune with feelings like these â colonel â s smile a little it changed its character from tenderness to amusement i wonder which of my feelings she would be out of tune with though he added i am afraid i am beginning to

what had once been should remain forever here but with the glad colours of life not the faded ones of death upon it it satisfied her conscience to do this for it appeared to her that so very much of good had been granted her of late so large a measure of peace and hope vouchsafed to her that it was but fitting she should bear testimony to her of all that by of the last outward sign of the rebellion of her sorrowful youth the richard of to day busy with much kindness thoughtful of her comfort her with delicate â which to receives them makes her womanhood a privilege rather than a burden â yet her not a little too in the security of a fair and equal affection bore such moving resemblance to that other richard first master of her heart that could afford to the cruelty of certain memories retaining only the portion of them and could find a peculiar sweetness in of this room formerly devoted wholly to sense of injury and blackness of hate and on the day in question s presence a specially tender brightness even as the thirsty earth refreshed by the thunder rain sent up a rare whiteness as of incense smoke for she had been somewhat anxious about lately to her sensitive observation of him his virtue his of temper his had come to have in them a pathetic element he was lovely and pleasant in his ways but sometimes when tired or off his guard she had surprised an expression on his face a constrained patience of speech even of attitude which made her fear he had given her but that half of his confidence calculated to cheer while he kept the half calculated to rather to himself and in good truth richard did suffer not a little at this period the first push of enthusiastic conviction had passed while his new manner of conduct and of thought had not yet acquired the of habit the tide was low and sand bars disclosed themselves he endured the temptations arising from the state known to writers as spiritual and found those temptations of an and wholly sort and though he held his the new heaven and new earth feared for him â feared that the way he elected to walk in was over strait and that though resolution would hold health might be my darling you never now she had said to him a few days back to which he answered â poor dear mother have i cheated you of one of your few small pleasures was it so very delightful to listen to that same grumbling i begin to believe it was declared it conferred a distinction upon me you see because i had a comfortable conviction you grumbled to nobody else one is jealous of distinction yes â i think i miss it whereupon he laughed and kissed her and swore he d fast enough if there was anything â which positively there wasn t â to about au of which though it charmed appeased her anxiety but the young man worked too hard his opportunities of amusement were too scant cast about in thought and in prayer for some of his daily life even if such should lessen the completeness of his dependence upon herself and it was just at this juncture that miss st wrote proposing to come to for a week she had not been there since the recess she wrote from where she was staying on her way south after paying a round of country house visits in scotland it was now september she would probably go to for the winter with young lady â grand niece by marriage of her late god mother and â whose lungs were pronounced to be badly touched might she therefore come to to say good bye and to this proposed visit richard offered no opposition though he received the announcement of it without any marked demonstration of approval â oh by all means let her come of course it must be a pleasure to his mother to have her and he d got on very well with her in the spring â he had â richard s expression was slightly â but he did really like her â oh dear yes he her exceedingly she was quite curiously clever and she was sincere and she was rather beautiful too in her own style â he had always thought that by all means have her â after which conversation richard went for a long ride cottages in building at and visited a house extensive internal alterations which stands back from s green about a hundred yards short of the s shop at row he came in late unusual sir richard silence held him during dinner and lady took herself to task herself with selfishness was very dear to her and so only too probably she had the friendliness of s attitude towards the young lady but they had seemed to get on so extremely well in the spring and very fairly well at yet perhaps in that as in so much else richard put a upon himself obeying conscience rather than inclination was nor had her yesterday upon miss st s arrival richard remained today however matters had improved something â possibly the â seemed to have his coldness broken up his of manner therefore gave thanks and moved with a lighter heart as for miss st herself an innate pervaded her aspect not easy to resist lady had been sensible of it when the young lady first greeted her that morning it remained by her now as she stood after luncheon at one of the open windows watching the up rolling thunder cloud the the solemn behaviour of the was easily entertained to day she felt weu disposed towards every living creature and the diverted her extremely they reminded her of certain garden parties with this improvement ,32
subtle and troubles the only ones which my poor elizabeth had to struggle with at this period there were others of a plain obvious and material character which caused her a good deal of anxiety during the last year and a half she had spent a large sum of money a house after the and fanciful manner of the present day a considerable then elizabeth had expended a good deal upon her clothes she had a natural tendency towards surrounding herself with the best of everything had advised her to be charming and please her friends she was charming she was more â she was in a way magnificent no doubt it is a most admirable thing to be magnificent but unfortunately it costs a lot of money certainly she had not entertained much so that the actual expenses of her housekeeping ought not to have been great yet even in this department a good deal more had been i mrs part ii spent than was actually necessary elizabeth had been rather worried for some time but by the end of march her financial position was such that she perceived some very distinct change in her manner of living to be absolutely indispensable frank was his brother s and was by way of managing elizabeth s affairs for her but in point of fact they had hardly ever mentioned money matters to each other frank had plenty of other things to do and had troubled himself very little about his obligations in the matter and elizabeth always had a tendency to take her fate rather forcibly into her own hands it is never agreeable to allow even to that one has been and foolishly extravagant still less is it agreeable to invite the criticism of another person in the matter elizabeth put off speaking to her brother in law as long as possible though she had great confidence both in his ability and to help her but at last she had to admit that no other course was open to her not caring to include mrs frank in her confidence â she had conceived a slight distrust of her charming sister in law lately â she wrote privately to frank various necessary papers and statements and begging him to come the first evening he was at liberty and deliver his verdict on the situation frank was of a very reasonable temperament as a rule he had not the least inclination to quarrel with things as they are but he had often felt it hard that the world had not been con ch vi a sketch in black and white on some principle which would have it unnecessary for him ever to have to say anything unpleasant to anybody you may call this inherent sweetness of nature or a lamentable want of moral courage as you please the more delicate virtues always run the risk of being included under the head of weakness of character any way frank found no righteous satisfaction in the brother and the sister seemed to him if possible even more objectionable he felt that elizabeth had been very careless and extravagant but he had not the smallest desire to tell her so consequently he arrived at her house on the evening of the day following mr s stormy visit with a sense upon him that he had a most duty to accomplish he struggled to put off the evil moment of delivering his opinion on elizabeth s expenses as long as possible and took refuge in a little general conversation to begin with i heard from this morning he said when their first greetings were over frank stood with his back to the fire in the attitude so natural to man when he finds himself in the house of a near relation or intimate friend it was only a line he s gone down to â says he is gone there on business that is really a statement as coming from him s capacity for business is of the most primitive and description you know i don t somehow understand it he mrs part ii added it seems to me he must have been very much put to it for an excuse before he would take refuge in talking of business to me i can t conceive why he s gone off just now the country must be chilly elizabeth had been standing near him by the fire as he spoke she moved away and sitting down on a sofa near the window began and a black and gold fan which hung at her side with an appearance of considerable interest oh business means drawings i suppose she answered without looking up i he s got some fresh orders there are always a lot of people staying at he may have arranged to meet mrs there he began a drawing of her last season and never finished it yes i know remarked frank offended him somehow and he wouldn t go on with it is rather a vulgar creature i admit elizabeth put up her eyebrows slightly isn t he sufficiently punished in the possession of such a universally attractive wife poor man she said frank shrugged his shoulders as kindly for the of the whole house of she told me elizabeth continued one day that she made it a rule always to go into retreat in lent i inquired where and she said oh at so she s sure to be there now pleasant for said frank smiling complimentary to find yourself and your ch vi a sketch in black and white house regarded in the light of a practical of the world elizabeth did not answer if s gone to draw why can t he just say so though remarked frank after a moment s pause contemplating the with an air of mild suspicion i hate mysteries used to be so but he s changed somehow lately he is sometimes he seems as if ,32
on the platform she closed her eyes and allowed her chin to fall and so sat with her hands in her lap indifferent to everything caring for nothing but rest and she was so white again â white as how the faces of that packed mass of humanity lighted up with interest and with what intensity all eyes gazed upon this fragile girl and how natural it was for these people realized that at last they were looking upon that person whom they had so long to see a person whose name and fame filled all europe and made all other names and all other insignificant by comparison of arc the wonder of the time and destined to be the wonder of all times and i could read as by print in their countenances the words that were drifting through their minds can it be true is it that it is this little creature this girl this child with the good face the sweet face the beautiful face the dear and face that has carried by storm charged at the head of victorious armies blown the might of england out of her path with a breath and fought a long campaign solitary and alone against the brains and learning of france â and had won it if the fight had been fair evidently had grown afraid of by of arc because of his pretty apparent toward for another was in the chief place here which left my master and me nothing to do but sit idle and look on well i supposed that everything had been done which could be thought of to tire s body and mind but it was a mistake one more device had been invented this was to preach a long sermon to her in that oppressive heat when the preacher began she cast up one distressed and disappointed look then dropped her head again this preacher was an he got his text from the twelve lies he emptied upon all the in detail that had been up in that mess of and called her all the brutal names that the twelve were with working himself into a of fury as he went on but his labors were wasted she seemed lost in dreams she made no sign she did not seem to hear at last he launched this o france how hast thou been abused thou hast always been the home of christianity but now charles who calls himself thy king and governor like the and that he is the words and deeds of a worthless and infamous woman v raised her head and her eyes began to burn and flash the preacher turned toward her it is to you that i speak and i tell you that your king is and a by ic k of arc he might abuse her to his heart s content she could endure that but to her dying moment she could never hear in patience a word against that that treacherous dog our king whose proper place was here at this moment sword in hand these and saving this most noble servant that ever king had in this world â and he would have been there if he had not been what i have called him s loyal soul was outraged and she turned upon the preacher and flung out a few words with a spirit which the crowd recognized as being in accordance with the of arc traditions by my faith sir i make bold to say and swear on pain of death that he is the most noble christian of all christians and the best lover of the faith and the church there was an explosion of applause from the crowd â which the preacher for he had been aching long to hear an expression like this and now that it was come at last it had fallen to the wrong he had done all the work the other had carried off all the spoil he stamped his foot and shouted to the â make her shut up that made the crowd laugh a mob has small respect for a grown man who has to call on a to protect him from a sick girl had the preacher s cause more with by of arc i one sentence than he had helped it with a hundred so he was much put out and had trouble to get a good start again but he needn t have there was no occasion it was mainly an mob it had but obeyed a law of our nature â an irresistible law â to enjoy and a spirited and promptly delivered retort no matter who makes it the mob was with the preacher it i had been for a moment but only that it would soon return it was there to see this burnt so that it got that satisfaction â without too much delay â it would be content presently the preacher formally summoned to submit to the church he made the demand with confidence for he had gotten the idea from and that she was worn to the bone exhausted and would not be able to put forth any more resistance and indeed to look at her it seemed that they must be right nevertheless she made one more effort to hold her ground and wearily â as to that matter i have answered my judges before i have told them to report all that i have said and done to our holy father the pope â to whom and to god first i appeal again out of her native wisdom she had brought those words of tremendous import but was ignorant of their value but they could have availed her nothing in any case now with the stake there and these thousands of enemies about h h yet by of arc made every there and the preacher changed the subject with all haste well might those for ,34

arc the fear of the fiery death was gone from of arc now to come again no more except for one fleeting then it would pass and serenity and courage would take its place and abide till the end by

recorded in history than this weeping helpless praying crowd holding their lighted candles and kneeling on the pavement beneath the prison walls of the old fortress and it was so all the way thousands upon thousands upon their knees and stretching far down the distances thick sown with the faint yellow candle flames like a field with golden flowers but there were some that did not kneel these were the english soldiers they stood elbow to elbow on each side of s road and walled it in all the way and behind these living walls knelt the multitudes by and by a frantic man in priest s garb came

it is probably a result of the formation of the establishment at mount itself something more and better than the mere love of novelty or the ordinary admiration of what is admirable is certainly at its foundation it itself in works that speak louder than any language our has become within the few years of its existence a model for all similar institutions in the united states and more of these have been founded within the last half dozen years than during the whole two centuries that preceded them at this moment associations in several of our principal cities and towns are engaged in such it is well known that are continually made from these parties for relating to mount the multitudes of foreigners and other strangers who frequent the northern during the travelling season experience the same want for them there is no resort of using that word in its just philosophical sense in boston or its vicinity equally with this pleasant though mournful spot nothing more perhaps is needed to complete their enjoyment of it than a better knowledge than can at present be easily obtained of the causes and sources to which they are indebted for the pleasure it gives them of the principles upon which tbe establishment is conducted and of the means by which its yet may be in every section of the land in drawing up this account which we propose to render as practically useful as may be we have sought to our by to original and official documents for the introduction of which we are confident the reader will require of us no apology beyond what is implied in this explanation the subject is not of a character to excite the meditative mind for the moment to a mood of matter of ct but it is certain on the other hand that a sentimental history â if such a thing might be â is not what is wanted the considerations of a general nature which first led to the of measures for the foundation of the establishment at mount are such as are already we must presume to such of our readers as have reflected on the subject at all in the address delivered at its by mr justice story they are expressed with equal force and beauty as also in the reports of of the society published in and written by some of our most distinguished citizens these papers be in this history or added to it in due course meanwhile it is proper to remark that not only sentiments and reflections similar to those which these express had long been entertained by many members of this community but certain steps towards the putting of such designs in execution had been taken some years at least prior to the actual result now well known to the public the earliest meeting on the subject of the so as we have been able to ascertain was held in november at the house and by the instance of history of our respected fellow citizen dr jacob on which occasion were present with himself messrs john george bond william thomas w ward samuel p john and hale the design of a somewhere in the vicinity of the city met with unanimous approval and messrs bond and were appointed a committee to make and report a suitable piece of ground for the purpose the committee were unsuccessful in their and never reported nor was the subject ever revived in any way by these immediate parties the next movement was in when dr having obtained from w esq the offer of sweet for a public at the price of six thousand dollars communicated the fact to the officers of the society and engaged their co operation as private individuals in a great effort to accomplish the object in view a meeting of members of that society was held on the of november by invitation of messrs and john c gray to discuss the plan of a to be connected with an garden of the society a committee of the society was now appointed consisting of messrs h a s jacob edward g bond j c gray and george w these gentlemen called a more general meeting on the eighth of june to consider the details of a plan now about to be carried into execution c on this occasion the attendance was large mr justice story took the chair and the hon e acted as mount great interest and entire were expressed in regard to the design of the meeting it was now â to purchase sweet

gentlemen were chosen â messrs joseph story daniel h a s charles samuel jacob edward george w george bond a h james t joseph p charles charles p cook john l m and george w an elaborate report on the

of the same family of mist or cloud hovering in the gold radiance of the upper atmosphere stepping from one to another of the clouds that rested on the hills and thence to the brotherhood that sailed in air it seemed almost as if a mortal man might thus ascend into the heavenly regions earth was so mingled with sky that it was a day dream to look at it to supply that charm of the familiar and homely which nature so readily into a scene like this the stage coach was rattling down the mountain and the driver sounded his horn while echo caught up the notes and them into a rich and varied and elaborate harmony of which the original could lay claim to little share the great hills played a concert among themselves each a strain of airy sweetness little joe s face brightened at once dear

circle â snow white too and thoroughly converted into lime â lay a human skeleton in the attitude of a person who after long toil lies down to long repose within the ribs â strange to say â was the shape of a human heart was the fellow s heart made of marble cried in some perplexity at this phenomenon at any rate it is burnt into what looks like special good lime and taking all the bones

repetition of bell he has been the passive hero of wonderful with which i have chanced to become acquainted possibly from his own mouth while the careless multitude supposed him to be talking merely of the time of day or calling them to dinner or to church or bidding drowsy people go or the dead to their graves a revolution has it been his to go through and a bell s biography a prodigious uproar and whether or no he have told me his reminiscences this at least is true that the more i study his deep toned language the more sense and sentiment and soul do i discover in it this bell â for we may as well drop our quaint â is of antique french manufacture and the symbol of the cross that it was meant to be suspended in the of a place of worship the old people have a tradition that a considerable part of the metal was supplied by a cannon captured in one of the of louis the over the and that a princess threw her golden into the mass it is said likewise that a bishop and blessed

could make so an image of a warrior in brass or marble that if a trumpet were sounded over his tomb you would expect him to start up and handle his sword the earl whom we now speak of however has slept soundly in spite of a more serious disturbance than any blast of a trumpet unless it were the final one some centuries after his death the floor of the chapel fell down and broke open the stone coffin in which he was buried and among the fragments appeared the earl of with the colour scarcely faded out of his cheeks his eyes a little sunken but in other respects looking as natural as if he

year the members of the lower house are elected by the people must he thirty years old and pay a small amount of taxes we will now as briefly as possible review the complicated history of italy the political geography of this country has italy and gone many changes during the twenty five centuries and more through which history extends if we examine a good historical of europe we shall find that on the the part of the which was called italy did not reach so far north as till the seventh century after the foundation of rome and that the valley of the po was not considered italian territory till a century later towards the close of the fifth century of our era we find the whole set down as a part of the great kingdom of the or eastern at the commencement of the ninth century the empire of occupied the whole of the valley of the po and more than half of the to the south of it while the of took up nearly all the rest one hundred and seventy five years later the empire reached nearly to and the of and occupied the rest was governed hy a count about the year germany claimed the valley of the po and the northern portion of the the states of the church which have existed from to our day without many changes were in the centre the kingdom of south and the kingdom of was on the island of the same name in when was taken by the the north of italy was occupied by the of and the of which fell in and in the central and southern parts were the republic of ii i the states of the church and the st shores or kingdom of the two at the close of the reign of the emperor charles v all italy was under the sway of the house of but the only noticeable change on the map was the of the of at the expense of at the time of the treaty of the of and and were in existence a little later the kingdom of the two was divided into the of and but only to be under the former name from to the end of the first napoleon s reign the changes were too many to be even indicated here but in s after the treaty of we find on the map the kingdom of and the possessions and in the north the of and the grand of and the states of the church in the middle and the kingdom of the two in the south in began the movements which resulted in a united italian nation the name of this country comes from that of a people â â who originally lived in the southern part of the no one can tell who were the first inhabitants of italy in england france and germany we know that before the european race took up its abode there a people wandered over these countries lived by hunting and fishing making their implements of stone clay or bones themselves with and the teeth of animals and were entirely ignorant of and the use of the but in italy no trace of such a primitive young america in italy and people has been found and there is nothing to prove that men lived in the italian before the discovery of and the use of the passing over tlie history of italy several greek colonies existed in the south when rome was founded in the centre were tlie the kindred tribes and north of these were the the and were closely related and the were of the same race but who the were and where they came from are questions which have not been satisfactorily answered they were more highly civilized than their neighbors and the borrowed many customs and from them i have not time to the wars of the in which they all the of italy the struggles between the two branches of the the and the reached down to the end of the fourth century our era â the fourth from the foundation of from this time the progress was rapid till he conquest extended beyond the of italy md were finally under the empire bounded by the the the the ind the ocean roman history begins with the kings b c nd the last of the seven lost lis

lived in twelve or fifteen miles from to sunny shores oh i had never heard of his visiting his uncle now he had taken up residence in my father s house apparently for no other purpose than to his suit with me after this first stormy interview with i retreated overwhelmed with grief and anger to my chamber i wept and groaned for a long time for i knew that my guardian had the power to dispose of me as he pleased while i was considering what i should do in order to escape the fate marked out for me i thought of something which i wished to say to my guardian and hastened to his office to say it when i came to the door i heard the voices of and i listened for i knew that their conversation must relate to me it did indeed for my wicked guardian was speaking of my as though he intended to give my husband only a portion of my father s wealth i soon learned that this portion was five hundred thousand or about a fourth of what my father had left at his death i was to marry because he was willing to accept this of my property in place of the whole of it i was confounded and overwhelmed at this infamous bargain and i resolved at once to see my father s friend in and appeal to him i was not again permitted to visit him and i was watched so that i could not communicate with him i was miserable beyond description in my extremity i appealed to for help but my guardian gave us no time to carry out the plans we had arranged for my escape it was only yesterday morning that young america in italy and i told me that i was to go with him his wife and on a tour to egypt i had long wished to travel and especially to visit oriental lands he rubbed his hands and pictured to me the delights of the journey i only suspected that it was to keep me away from the count di but told me that s father was a member of the italian at i was satisfied then that i was to be made the wife of my guardian s nephew before my n and i shuddered with horror at the thought advised me to pretend to submit and yesterday afternoon i came to with his wife and the steamer was to leave at half past eleven in the evening she arrived from at ten and we hastened on board of her i went to my cabin and made up a little bundle of needful clothing and i had a thousand given me by my guardian and saved from my pocket money had told me to do all this with the bundle imder my cloak i left the cabin and found him ready for me we went on shore in the crowd and waited till the steamer left i trembled witli agitation all the time but conducted me to a boat which he had purchased and in the darkness he rowed away from the land sunny shores i chapter iv the t tt thy did you take a boat asked o as v y paused in her narrative with the feeling that she had told her story as much in detail as was necessary to enable the officer to understand it i did just what my faithful me to do though he fully explained his reasons when i asked for them replied the italian maiden â he said that would discover my absence when the steamer reached in the morning if not before he would certainly return by the early train to was sure lie would be able to find wherever we went on shore while the sea would leave no traces behind of our departure we had dined at the de france at six o clock and while we were at the table had purchased the boat on the outskirts of the city and taken it to the but didn t you think it was dangerous to pull out to sea in that little boat i didn t care anything at all about it if i could only escape the fate my guardian had prepared for me i would rather be drowned now in the deepest depths of the than become the wife of such a wretch as young america in italy and where did you intend to go in the boat i hardly knew and cared little but said that we could get upon some vessel going up the or across it i had money to pay our passage and all i desired was to prevent from tracing us why you go to your father s friend in asked o he was my friend but he had no power to protect me against my but where is the count he is at but of course i could not appeal to him or even see him after i had left my guardian replied blushing though the second master was born in italy he had no idea of the severe propriety with which young ladies in that country are taught to conduct themselves you expected tb reach some town or city after some vessel had picked you up what did you expect to do there i had not decided what to do thought of seeking shelter in some religious house and then writing to my father s friend in or to my uncle in i don t think will be likely to find you added o you will not betray me you will not send me back to pleaded the beautiful italian i won t certainly and i don t believe the principal will either you have made out a good case and i can t think that mr will hand you sunny shores or over to such a villain as your ,36
mean part in a delicate matter and i did not hesitate so to express myself my father having a large family to maintain with his pay greatly reduced was in very circumstances and mr proposed to point out a way by which i could make five thousand dollars for my father s sake i listened to the offer well sir what were you to do for the five thousand dollars asked the captain as the speaker paused in his narrative when he came to the part thereof i was to get mr into difficulty and injure his credit with the officers was that all i was to dispose of him as i could dispose of him do you mean that you to take his life mr may have entertained that view but i never did by the yankee or mr never entertained any such view interposed that gentleman speak for yourself if you speak at all indeed sir i never accepted the offer added mr brightening up as though he had found a means of clearing himself from all blame but you commenced operations when you locked mr up in the store room no sir i am willing to acknowledge that i despised him for his meanness in the matter i have mentioned and was willing to play him a trick when i got a chance i never intended to injure him â only to annoy him how came mr to make you this offer i heard that and myself were to be appointed to this vessel a week before i was sent on board and i told mr so mr with another man to hand mr over as a prisoner on board the added the captain i did not know that sir replied as nearly as i can judge you were to do the dirty job if the other man failed i was not to do that â at least i never intended to injure mr you have done enough to disgrace any officer you are under arrest i beg you â by the adventures of a naval officer i have nothing more to report to the arms under arrest i wish to sir so far as miss is concerned i never had the remotest idea of mr interposed blushing like a child i never paid her any attentions such as mr i never made love to her in a word mr thought he had not he had no serious intentions â indeed no intentions at all but it is quite likely he did not understand the matter the captain went on deck followed by while and were handed over to the master by the yankee ob chapter xvii the in sound captain was in the cabin working up the case of mr the first lieutenant was making the details for the crew of the and brought up their bags and the boat put off the and of the steamer were willing to retain their positions on certain conditions but it was deemed necessary to have a large force of yankee sailors on board in case of any attempt to her the was to keep near her and to be by her in light or head winds mr was now first officer of the steamer and the place had been assigned to him at the special request of mr he was young but he was considered fully competent to perform the duties of the position the boat returned to the which immediately filled away on her course the wheels of the were started and with a quarter master to con the wheels she followed in the by the adventures of a naval officer wake of her little during that day the was able to hold way with the steamer but at sunset the wind subsided and a was passed from her to the the purposes of our story do not require us to follow the return voyage in detail and we pass over the tame incidents of an unbroken passage tiu the took on board a pilot about a hundred miles east of sandy hook though our had been absent from home but a brief period they were anxious to the war news and the bundle of papers which the pilot brought on board were examined with great eagerness they were three days old but they were nearly a week later than any the officers had seen there was no very exciting news but who had a very decided for newspapers devoted himself to a careful perusal of them as soon as he was relieved from duty on deck of course he read the war news first and while looking over the paper for other matters of interest his attention was attracted by a familiar name â no other than that of his gaze was instantly to the paragraph for everything connected with that name had a kind of charm about it the paragraph in which he had found it announced the dangerous illness of general who had been attacked by the papers were sent on board the with this sentence marked that it by the yankee ob might not escape the attention of the captain the announcement would give mr a thrill of anxiety hut it would not be on account of the impending death of one who had been his guardian and protector but for the final disposition of his large property perhaps the general was already dead and it was not impossible that the prisoner on board the was the heir of a quarter of a million money covers a multitude of sins and if the general had carried out what was understood to be his intention and made joint heir with of his estates it would not be a difficult matter for him to break through the of the law from this point of view the matter was one of no interest to on tuesday

and more into as years went by miss was much the by her increased for intercourse with all sorts ami conditions of women but the brother seemed to have let bis individuality out to the dry pages of hia books as if tliey were a species of ous and in time to completely him he never asked hia sister for money but she spared him she was not that one cause of shop he looked at her very wistfully as be put the price of her self slowly into his pocket and vaguely up a feeble ghost of his purpose to more make things op to her by and by but his pockets clung together for very and some longed for pile of dusty was slipping out of his grasp with every hour he even found himself at the shining silver tea service of which ba and miss were the sole away in tbe useless a and â he was quite ble of the whole of the plate in these of anguish and he was a book at last it was a mercy that he in for the vicinity of and ragged of on comer of the great towns would either have made him mad or a hardened against justice as tiie years slipped by he gained some little as a quite for he was too firmly into his position as idle and reader to exercise his powers of thought he was only a memory with no gift at combination and association an a very rag bag of true and worthless knowledge and the easy life which made no demands upon him seemed to bold no inspiration in any of lights or â the library slowly grow the man himself really yet he was thought a much wiser and more person than the resolute and gentle sister who kept her petty shop as intently as that famous grandfather had managed his shipping she was â glad to spend what energy she â the business and tried to a t t that she was by nature a business woman yet she at first insisted upon the ou family custom of reading aloud and so upon sharing as much of her brother s evenings as possible sometimes she was but as a rule her own evening leisure was respected and the solitary lamp on the shop counter hinted that no errands except of necessity were expected or pi for h the brother was glad that their bad not lived to be wounded by the sound of the shop bell miss was rejoiced she had never been forced to surrender all hope of her son s gaining die but and good breeding kept a harmonious atmosphere in the ou house and on summer sundays when were strangers in the village neighbors still pointed out mr and as tho interesting figures is the congregation for a long time there was little is tlie quiet old but there came a day when everybody acknowledged that was waking up it has already been thai a large sum of money was left in for the of a library the a village old well endowed and along line of its earlier history seemed to take a now lease of life and as in days of the past a successful teacher drew round him the brightest boys and girls of the neighboring towns there were more and more people too who discovered the beauties of the wide river and its wooded banks and from tlie neighboring on the near by increasing numbers of summer came inland like birds of passage to linger for a while in the shade of the great elms the time honored repose of tlie village seemed permanently broken and not tlie least attractive figure was this stately miss who had achieved the dignity of self sacrifice in supporting her learned brother it was considered a true romance when the village people discovered this aspect of the through tlie help of others tbey were delightfully eager to upon the old time majesty of the and the â low succession of its could only guess at the self denial which made it possible for the dear lady to do her part in giving for the good of or hale or to carry forward even in a s fashion the old time and of the house what gave gave and with that which lord him loves tlie bright young people were a great to dignified as tliey went flitting about the in gay gowns or lingered in her with sweet looks some found their way into the parlor and learned to know tlie rest of the fine old house and were even graciously en at tea to their hearts delight aad admiration more than one el the house s old acquaintances away to a glowing description of this fine in lier nobly

as winter took the place of summer and these gay guests disappeared like the village seemed more familiar again and as if it had turned over for another nap the walls of the new library were rising miss liked to bear the of tlie and one day s a that she was growing old and was no to follow herself and in tbe house there was one comfort he had not gathered his books for nothing she would urge him

on wheels so many of us felt kind o stiff there s one thing â folks won t never say again that we can t show no public here in old jim s little woman i there was laughter in the lanes of st when jim returned from a northern voyage with a northern wife he had sailed on the dawn of day one and ninety two tons burden with a full cargo of yellow pine and shells not that the shells were mentioned in the bill of any more than five handsome shells that were securely lashed to the beams in the captain s cabin these were a private venture of the captain s and jim s the dawn of day did a great deal of trading with the islands and it was only when the season of northern was over that her owners found it more profitable to her in the lumber business it was too hot for bringing any more from the last were half spoiled in the hold and those who came excitedly after and jim little woman nuts and baskets who would gladly pay thirty cents apiece for the best of the shells brought by way of â those enthusiastic money had all flown homeward at the first hints of unmistakable heat and market was over for that spring st is a city of bright sunshine and of cool sea winds a different place from the steaming hot southern ports which jim knew well â and and the rest he had sailed between the islands and st and and made trading voyages round into the gulf ever since he ran away to sea on an ancient bound for in his early youth jim s grandfather was a northern man by birth a new who had married a woman and settled down in st to spend the rest of his days their old house near the sea wall faced one of the narrow lanes that ran up from the water but it had a wide window in the end and here jim remembered that the old sailor sat and watched the harbor and the of vessels and defended his pet orange tree from the of boys jim s little woman his wife died long before he did and the daughter jim s mother was married and her husband ran away and never was heard from and jim himself was ten years old when he walked at the head of the funeral procession dimly imagining that the old man had gone up north and that he was to live again there among the scenes of his youth there were a few old walking two by two who had known the captain in his active life but they held no definite views about his permanent in high still there was a long procession and a handsome funeral and after a few years jim s mother died too a friendly little creature whom everybody lamented jim into port one day after a long absence expecting to be kissed and cried over and to church and mended up to find the old house locked and empty he gloomily there was nothing for him to do ashore and that year the boys took all the and people said that the old captain s ghost lived in the house the bishop stopped jim one day on the and told him that he must come to church sometimes for his mother s sake she was a good little woman and had jim s little woman said many a prayer for her boy did jim ever say a prayer for himself it was a hard life going to sea and he must not let it be too hard for his soul marry you a good wife soon said the kind bishop be a good man in your own town you will be tired of and wiu want a home god have pity on you my boy jim took off his hat reverently and his frank bold eyes met the bishop s sad kind eyes and fell he had never really thought what a shocking sort of fellow he was until that moment he had grown used to his mother s crying but it was two or three years now since she died the fellows on board ship were afraid of him when he was surly and owned him for king when he was pleased to turn life into a joke he was northern and southern by turns this southern bom young sailor he could talk in yankee fashion like his grandfather until the crew shook the ship s with their laughter but in all his sea life he had never been to the coast of this story begins the dawn of day was a slow and what wind she had was only a light breeze every other day was a jim little woman dead calm and so they drifted up the northern coast as if the gulf stream alone impelled them making for the island of mount desert with their yellow pine for and somewhere near harbor their provisions got low and the drinking water was too bad altogether and there was nothing else left to drink so the captain put in for supplies they could not get up to the inner harbor next the town but came to anchor near a little village when the wind fell at there were some houses in sight dotted along the shore and a long low building at the water s edge close to the little bay jim and the captain and another man pulled ashore to see what could be done about the water and the old water which had been rusty was and good for nothing when they first put to sea jim went ashore and presently put his head into a window of the long low building there were a dozen young people there and two or three men with heaps of shells and ,40

and her short crop of red curly hair stood out about her pale face under the round hat she had been thinking of jim and of her afternoon s and of a strange little old negro woman who had been looking out of a doorway on george street as she passed it seemed to as if this old withered creature could see ghosts in the street instead of the live by she never looked at anybody who passed but sometimes she stood there for an hour looking down the street and strange words to herself jim s little woman was not without her own she had been very miserable of late about jim and especially since she found his lucky shell if she could only see him coming home in her dream she had always dreamed of him before suddenly she became aware that all the little black boys were running through the streets like with single or limp over ripe of a dozen and she turned quickly running a few steps in her eagerness jim s little woman to see the bay why had she not looked that way before there at the pier were the tall and the black and green of the dawn of day she had come in that morning felt dizzy and had to lean for a minute against the old cathedral doorway there was a of music inside she heard it and lost it then it came again as her passed and she ran like a child down the street her hat blew off and she caught it with one hand but did not stop to put it on again the long pier was black with people down at the end next the and they were up over the side and from the deck there were red and white from the hotel in the middle of the crowd and a general hurry and excitement everybody but seemed to have known hours before that the was in perhaps she ought to go home first jim might be there now she could see the pretty baskets heaped on the top of the cabin and the shining colors of shells and gi een of for planting and the great white branches and heads of coral she could smell the ripe fruit in the hold and catch sight of some of the crew at last she was on the jim s little woman and somebody on deck swore a great oath under his breath boys he said in a loud whisper here s jim s little woman and two or three of them dropped quickly between decks and down into the hold rather than face her when she came on board there was nobody to b seen but the hard faced cabin boy whom she had taken care of in a fever as they came down from he had been driving a brisk trade with some ladies down in the captain s cabin where s jim gone said looking at him fiercely with her suspicious gray eyes you d better go ask the cap n said the boy he was two years older than when she first knew him but he looked much the same only a little harder then he remembered how good had been to him and that the old man was in a horrid temper he took hold of s thin little hand and got her away aft into the shadow and behind the s large boat look here he faltered i m awful sorry it s too bad but â jim s dead jim s wife looked the young fellow straight jim s little woman in the face as if she were thinking about something else and had not heard him here sit right down on this box said the boy but would not sit down she had a dull sense that she must not stay any longer and that the sun was hot and that she not walk home along the alone i u go home with you said the boy giving hey a little push but she took hold of his hand and did not move say it over again what you said she insisted looking more and more strange her short red hair was blowing in the wind all about her face and her eyes had faded and faded until they looked almost white jim s dead said the hard looking boy who thought he should cry himself and wished that he were out of such a piece of business the people who had come to for shells began to look at them and to whisper he s dead he â well he was as steady as a most all the time we was laying off o and the ol man could n t master him to go an drink by night and jim he would n t let me go ashore told me he d bout kill me an i him up an down for and he never hit me a back nor jim s little woman he was queer this voyage i never see him drunk but once â when we first put into â and then he was a afterwards and into he got dizzy turns and was took sick and laid in his while we was t was hot you never see it so hot an the ol man told how twas his the water that give him a fever an when he went oflf his head the old man got the l folks an they him ashore a an he was just his last the day we sailed we see his funeral as we come out o harbor they was goin out of him right off i ain t seen it myself but jim was the last ashore an he asked if t was our jim an they said twas they d sent word in the he was bout gone and we might s well sail ,40
ever to be absolutely denied so reasonable a means of restoring their exhausted energy and cheerfulness more especially because those who are connected in any way with business or who have to provide by their own efforts for the maintenance of their families are generally so through the greater portion of each day as to be as far removed as possible from all opportunity of personal enjoyment it would indeed be a hard thing to refuse to the husband who returns home from his desk his counter or his fields the best seat or the food with any other indulgence his circumstances may afford here however in certain families exists a great difficulty for some men and i need not say they are of the unreasonable class are determined to have the and yet are unwilling to the expense from their habit of things in detail and looking upon them only as a whole they are utterly unconscious of the importance of every little addition in the shape of luxury to the general sum and thus the wife is placed the wives op england l in the painful either of denying her husband the gratification of his tastes and wishes or of bearing all the blame of conducting her household expenses on too extravagant a scale there are few situations in the long catalogue of female more than this for it must ever be borne in mind that men have a tendency to dislike the immediate instrument of their suffering or and this again brings us to observe another of their peculiarities so important in its influence upon the whole of married life that if a woman should venture to judge of man s love by her own she would probably commit one of the most fatal mistakes by which human happiness was ever wrecked the love of woman appears to have been created solely to minister that of man to be unto it is true his lead him daily to some labor or some effort for the maintenance of his family and he often believes that this labor is for his wife but the probability is that he would be just as attentive to his business and as eager about making money had he no wife at all â witness the number of single men who provide with as great care and as according to their wants for the of a house without either wife or child as it is the natural characteristic of woman s love in its most refined as well as its most practical development to be perpetually doing something for the good or the happiness of the object of her affection it is but reasonable that man s personal comfort should be attended to and in this the and satisfaction which most men on finding themselves placed at table before a favorite dish situated beside a clean hearth or with an empty sofa is of itself a sufficient reward for any sacrifice such indulgence may have cost in proofs of affection like these there is something which speaks home to the senses â something which man can understand without an effort and he will sit down to eat or compose himself to rest with more hearty towards the wife who has been thoughtful about these things than if she had been all day busily employed in writing a on morals for his especial benefit again man s dignity as well as his comfort must be unto i propose to treat this subject more fully in another chapter but in speaking of man s peculiarities it must never be forgotten that he ought not to be required to bear the least upon his dignity as a man and a husband the woman who has the bad taste and worse feeling to venture upon this experiment effectually herself for in proportion as her husband sinks she must sink with him and ever as wife be lower still many however from ignorance and with the very best intentions in this way and i am inclined to think such persons suffer more from the consequences of their folly than others do from their wilful from what is right just as self love is more wounded by an innocent than by an humiliation because the latter shows us how little we are really esteemed while the former us with a certain degree of importance as being worthy of a insult it is unquestionably the right of all men whether ill or well rich or poor wise or foolish to be treated with deference and made much of in their own houses it is true that in the last mentioned case this duty may be attended with some difficulty in the performance but as no man becomes a fool or loses his senses by marriage the woman who has selected such a companion must abide by the consequences and even he whatever may be his degree of folly is entitled to respect from her because she has voluntarily placed herself in such a position that she must necessarily be his inferior i have said that whether well or ill a husband is entitled to respect and it is perhaps when ill more than at any other time that men are impressed with a sense of their own importance it is therefore an act of kindness as well as of justice and a concession easily made to endeavor to keep up this idea i characteristics op men p by all those little acts of delicate attention which at once do good to the body and sustain the mind illness is to men a sufficient trial and humiliation of itself as it them of their free agency cuts them off from their accustomed manly and them up to a kind of imprisonment which from their previous habits they are little calculated to bear a sensible and woman therefore will never inflict upon the man she loves when thus the additional punishment of feeling ,41
touch not my flowers too rudely nor tear one sweet scented blossom away torn my wreath and say not the tempest is howling around nor p int to the clouds that may gather but fly from my bright world where roses abound away to some lonely and desolate star just such a man as â spare my she exclaimed laughing and laying across his eyes a hand so exquisitely white and beautiful that few men would have wished for its removal sat under its pressure with patience if not with philosophy and she went on mention no names but tell me what you think of my power of your beauty you will not allow me to judge nor of your good sense since i may not even guess at the object of your choice but of your power to blind i am at this instant a living witness â and they say is a great help in the tender

never serious but â but i see that you have placed a white rose with the best possible effect amongst your hair â that you have arranged your dress with more than common attention â and that there is a bright sparkle in your eye that tells of anticipated triumph and what objection have you to my scheme nay you must first tell the merits of it oh a little change and tlie pleasure of laughing at a grave man all day are you so weary of us then or have you so little love and kindness shown you here that you wish to throw yourself upon the feelings of a stranger don t talk to me so gravely i will not stay to hear you i have promised to ride with mr this morning â will you see that my pony is ready as her light form flitted from before the eyes of a sad thought crossed his mind â more sad than the first to the spring blossoms â the first frost of autumn â the first cloud that passes over the moon when the midnight tempest is gathering it was the first injurious suspicion of her he loved â the first idea he had ever entertained that was less noble and affectionate than he had fondly deemed her s graceful form and girlish beauty were well displayed when mounted on a spirited pony which she in with dexterity while her eyes were lighted up with animation and her luxuriant hair which possessed the rare quality of curling naturally lost none of its beauty by waving in the fresh gale of an morning delighted with the gay picture which presented such a perfect contrast to his own dark lost himself in strange visions of what some would have called happiness said he suddenly breaking the chain of reflection and starting at the idea of his own familiarity there was something in his voice which invariably commanded attention and when his fair companion turned her face he for the freedom he had used saying he had found the name of associated with so much love and happiness that he had neglected to for any other then let it be said she with the frankness if not quite with the innocence of a child it is the name i bear from all who love me and cannot be from you like all proud and reserved persons was charmed with the which spared his dignity the cost of making advances and the ride was prolonged that morning over purple heath and until the party at home began to wonder whether the english gentleman and had heard the hour appointed for dinner indeed a general prevailing over the establishment made the time seem longer to those at home than it really was the family group had seen the two set off each some secret cause of disappointment scarcely acknowledged to themselves still less to each other had ordered her pony too and knew that she loved riding as well as any one but had mentioned herself only whenever she spoke of that morning s excursion with their visitor margaret was just going to show mr her when called him back telling him it was time to set off had given up the hat she wanted herself because complained that her own was not becoming and poor had never seen any other gentleman than himself riding with before but he had nothing to complain of and therefore he took his gun whistled up his dogs patted them with more cordiality than ever and comforted himself with the love of the dumb creatures in which nobody could rival him at a late hour returned with her companion hope in her eye and triumph on her brow absorbed entirely in herself and her own gratification she acted the part too often acted by young ladies and while affecting to be so amiable as to notice everybody showed each individual too plainly how absent they had been firom her thoughts to mrs she expressed surprise and concern that dinner should have had to wait with her she asked if she had tried her pony that morning of margaret who had lately suffered from a ankle she inquired whether she had been to the brow of the hill of rose who had risen with a bad head ache why she looked so dull and when dinner was nearly over she found out with regret that was not present it is by such as these that women the ridicule of men and the malice of each other the naked exposure of selfishness and vanity which madame de has exhibited in her palace of truth is surely less disgusting than this attempt at deception which the real ,41
with with behavior to husbands the perfect trust of a nobler nature on her own woman is raised to a degree of moral elevation which in her single state she never could have known and if her own disposition be generous and grateful she will feel it a sacred obligation not to abuse this trust but the great and important question arises how is this trust to be secured with the most ardent desire to enjoy this the chief good of married life and the foundation upon which all its happiness must rest there are two ways in which woman may effectually fail â and morally in the first she may fail from want of knowledge in the second from want of principle in the first instance whatever there may be in her conduct or conversation exhibiting a want of judgment of that perception of fitness and which is invaluable in the female character and of a proper acquaintance with common things is calculated to the confidence of her husband in her ability whatever her inclination may be to make a good wife a prudent mistress or a judicious mother it is in vain complaining that this sentence is a hard one when her heart is right and when she really does her best it is in vain complaining that her husband does not trust her either with the knowledge of his affairs or the management of her own confidence in one being is not a matter of choice in another it is what we ourselves must purchase by an absence of failure on those points in which the interests of another party are dependent upon us if then a husband finds in his wife a degree of ignorance which renders her incapable of judging rightly in common things if he finds that she has never made any proper use of her powers of observation that she has not been in the habit of thinking to any rational purpose of h ing or drawing right conclusions from what she has seen and heard it would be hard indeed to require him to believe that she will act with prudence and propriety as the mistress of a house and the natural consequence is that she must be watched suspected and in some degree treated as a child iâ therefore in a previous work i have earnestly recommended to the daughters of england an early and cultivation of their mental powers it has not been that such of character as are under the head of cleverness learning and knowledge or taste tact and observation should merely give zest to conversation or throw an intellectual charm over the society of the drawing room it is that the happy individual who possesses these advantages may on becoming a wife become also a companion in whom her husband can perfectly and at all times confide there are however cases in which the want of this confidence falls hardly because it is the inevitable result of circumstances over which the wife in her single state had no control one of these is where the mind is naturally weak and here the wife would certainly act most wisely by placing her actions and opinions under the direction of her husband and allowing herself to be treated accordingly but there are also those who from no fault of their own have before marriage enjoyed few advantages as regards mental cultivation in this case much may be done in the way of making up for loss time and where a desire to do so is evinced where a respectful and judicious reference to the husband s opinion is sometimes made and at other times a still more judicious silence observed these proofs of good sense and right feeling will go a long way towards obtaining the confidence desired but a far more serious and it is to be feared more frequent reason for the loss of this invaluable treasure is a moral one and here so many causes meet and combine in their operation that it would require no common degree of knowledge of the human heart to be able to point them out with and effect the first thing i shall in relation to this part of the subject is the essential importance there is that every husband should feel himself perfectly the wives op england l safe with his wife safe the worthy with whom could he be safe if not with me do i not watch him care for him and wait upon him with a solicitude that would screen him from every approach of harm all this may be true enough and yet you may occasionally have taken advantage of your intimacy for weaknesses on his part which need not otherwise have been known you may have marked your occasion when company was present for throwing out hints against him which you dared not have uttered when alone or you may have betrayed an evident triumph before your friends or your servants on obtaining over him some advantage in opinion or argument although such as these may appear but very trifling when separately yet their number and variety sometimes make up a sum of considerable magnitude and importance as they operate upon individual feeling and too clearly a want of delicacy generosity or real affection they lead in short to the very natural feeling on the part of the husband that his wife is not the bosom friend he had fondly imagined her that she knows no perfect identity of self with him but has separate interests to which he and his affairs are liable at any time to be made i have already said that the dignity of man should always be maintained but there is also a delicate and respectful manner of giving way to a husband in little things which is the means of obtaining on his part in those which are of greater moment simply because having found his wife generally ,41

the wretched said in a playful and subdued voice how you are sing me into my grave before i am ready for it looked up with anxiety and distress in their exchanging glances might be read the trust of a long tried and generous master and the simple and devoted love of a faithful servant whom nothing but death could separate from his lord and to whom that long dreaded separation would make the world a wilderness through which he would be a wanderer without a home marked the expression and saw that however harsh and rude lord might be to her h could be kind and gentle and familiar even to a and an

his return had scarcely paused however before the gathering of a crowd of men and boys along the side of the river attracted her attention and far in the distance she discovered two boats evidently with each other in the speed with which they cut through the water it requires very little to call together a crowd in london â very little to awaken anywhere in the minds of the idle and the thoughtless that which aims at pre eminence in folly or vice and thus the throng of spectators increased and the two boats came nearer and nearer until the dash of their oars would have been heard by but for the roll of carriages immediately beside and the general hum of the eat multitude of which she formed an item at last a shout was heard and there was a splash struggle â while the nearest boat rocked on one side and the stooped over and then while the minister s they ceased from their labors they seemed to be looking after something that was left behind another shout succeeded to the first and both the boats put back and rested on their oars while some of the men could be seen making up a of ropes and standing as if in readiness to throw it to any spot that might be indicated by others did not at first feel any apprehension about what had happened she thought it might have been a hat a coat or even a dog which had fallen but suddenly she seemed to be impelled by a kind of irresistible necessity to hasten to the spot and with a countenance of such deadly that those who looked into her face drew hack astonished and made way for her to pass she her way along the side not once looking to the right hand or the left but keeping her eye fixed steadily upon one particular point she succeeded in forcing a passage through the of the crowd and in standing directly opposite to where one of the boats was about to approach the land n or was it difficult for to by the exclamations of the crowd the frightful catastrophe which had occurred we haye him too said many at once but â and knew perfectly well without any of their coarse descriptions what was the reason why the could not by any possibility be she knew for by this time the lifeless form of her brother had been lifted out of the boat and while many crowded round to see the tall and manly youth who had met with this fate was the only one who claimed or who wished to claim kindred or association with the deceased take him said in a tone and attitude of command unusual to her when suddenly that she had neither home nor shelter in that vast city nor means of either she wrung her hands with an exclamation of s and distraction which made the police press near to her i the minister s and question her about her residence and her name thus though prepared in some measure for her great calamity was entirely overcome by the lesser besides which her mighty grief was sacred in itself it was also one in which that gazing crowd had nothing in and therefore she had locked it in her heart scarcely conscious of its real magnitude and waiting only for the time when she might be alone to ascertain its full extent but the sudden sense of poverty and loneliness which came upon her with the conviction that she had not where to bury her dead was what she was wholly un for and was her distress and such er inability to devise any means to relieve her melancholy that suspicions ran among the crowd of her not being quite herself and strange stories were soon set afloat about her with the young man who had been drowned all these however even had they reached the ear of would have affected her but little so deeply was her attention absorbed in the means which public benevolence employed for the restoration of her brother s life but in vain she laid her hand upon the senseless breast â upon the brow the

lingered about the heart the truth was too evident to admit of a doubt in any mind but hers that the high and spirit which once that manly form had left its earthly for ever there are certain individuals with whom we habitually connect ideas of sickness and decay and death if the wind blows coldly we single them out as objects of especial anxiety and after we have been separated from them for a while we scarcely dare inquire of their relatives about their health lest they should be dead but on the other hand there s are those whom we are e j disposed to from ail suspicion of bodily danger we see that they may and do nm a thousand risks with regard to prudence economy and general esteem but of their health we never think and their death h in the course of nature it must come at

to a who s been shut up in a brass bottle ever since the days of solomon who probably had very good reasons for putting him there next asked himself whether he was bound in honour to disclose the facts to mr and give him the opportunity of withdrawing from the agreement if he thought fit on the whole he saw no necessity for telling him anything the only possible result would be to make his suspect his and who would care to employ an insane then if he retired from the undertaking without any explanations what could he say to what would s father say to by ic the brass bottle him there would certainly be an end to his engagement after all he had not been to blame the were quite satisfied he felt perfectly sure that he could justify their selection of him he would wrong nobody by accepting the commission while he would only offend them injure himself and lose all hope of gaining if he made any attempt to them and was gone never to return so on all these considerations decided that silence was his only possible policy and though some may condemn his conduct as and wanting in true moral courage i venture to doubt whether any reader however independent straightforward and

more aspect altogether he was very much in love very happy and very busy â three states not invariably found in combination and as he had foreseen he had got rid of who was evidently too engrossed in the pursuit of solomon to think of anything else and there seemed no reason why he should abandon his search for a generation or two for it would probably take all that time to convince him that that mighty monarch was no longer on the throne it would have been too brutal to tell him myself thought when he was so keen on having his case and it gives him an object poor old and keeps him from interfering in my affairs so it s best for both of us s little ,44

if you shall the colonel the king of england should not have her and turning he stamped into the house and the door behind him bob walked slowly down the steps and around to the stables where he ordered his horse he rode home across the fields without a word except as he jumped his horse over the line fence i shall have her he repeated between his fast set teeth that evening came home all anything of the kind the colonel waited until she had taken off her things and come down in her fresh muslin dress she surpassed in loveliness the that lay on her bosom and the impertinence that could dare to her broke over the old man in a fresh wave he had nursed his wrath all the evening he out suddenly rising with a jerk from his arm chair and unconsciously striking an attitude before the astonished girl do you want to marry bob why no cried utterly shaken out of her composure by the suddenness and vehemence of the attack i knew it declared the colonel triumphantly it was a piece of cursed impertinence and he worked himself up to such a pitch of fury and grew so red in the face that poor little who had to steer between two dangers had to employ all her arts to soothe the old man and keep him out of a fit of she learned the truth however and she learned something which until that time she had never known and though as she kissed her uncle good night she made no answer to his final shot of well tm glad we are not going to have any nonsense about the fellow i have made up my o in virginia mind and we ll treat his impudence as it deserves she locked her door carefully when she was within her own room and the next morning she said she had a headache bob did not come that day if the colonel had not been so hot headed â that is if he had not been a man â things would doubtless have straightened themselves out in some of those mysterious ways in which the hardest knots into which two young people s affairs contrive to get themselves but being a man he must needs undertake to manage according to his own plan which is always the wrong one when therefore he announced to at the breakfast table that morning that she would have no further annoyance from that fellow s impertinence â for he had written him a note for leaving him abruptly in his own house the day before but forbidding him in both their names to continue his addresses or indeed to put his foot on the place again â he fully expected to see s face and to receive her approbation and thanks what then was his disappointment to see her face grow distinctly white all she said was oh uncle it was unfortunate that the day was sunday and that the colonel went with her to church which she insisted on attending notwithstanding her headache and was by when she met bob they came on each other suddenly bob took off his hat and stood like a soldier on review erect expectant and a little pale the colonel who had almost forgotten his impertinence and was about to shake hands with him as usual suddenly remembered it and drawing himself up stepped to the other side of and handed her by the younger as if he were protecting her from a mob who had been looking anxiously everywhere but in the right place meaning to give him a smile which would set things straight caught his eye only at that second and felt rather than saw the change in bob s attitude and manner she tried to give him the smile but it died in her eyes and even after her back was turned she was sensible of his defiance and she went into church and dropped down on her knees in the far end of her with her little heart all the of her religion the man she prayed hardest for did not come into church that day things went very badly after that and the knots got and an attempt which bob made to them failed and the colonel who was the best hearted man in the world but whose prejudices were made of wrought iron took it into his head that bob had insulted him and s efforts at aroused him to such an extent that for the first time in his life he was almost hard with her he conceived the absurd idea that she was sacrificing herself for bob on account of her friendship for him io in virginia and that it was his duty to protect her against herself which man like he proceeded to do in his own fashion to poor little s great distress she was devoted to her uncle and knew the strength of his affection for her on the other hand bob and she had been friends so long she never could remember the time when she did not have bob but he had never said a word of love to her in his life on that evening in the garden she had known it just as well as if he had fallen on his knees at her feet she knew it was just because he had owed her uncle the money and oh if she just hadn t gotten frightened and oh if her uncle just hadn t done it and oh she was so unhappy the poor little thing in her own dainty white room where were the books and things he had given her and the letters he had written her used to â but that is a

george â george washington â you mean george washington no madam he has not a of intelligence â he is and stupid i have never in fifty years been able to get an idea into his head oh dear and i thought him so clever i was wondering how so intelligent a person so well informed could be a slave the major faced about george george washington a slave madam you the situation he george washington s last is no slave i am the slave not only of him but of three hundred more as and as the and as lazy as the devil i miss threw up her hands in astonishment and the major who was on a favorite theme proceeded why madam the very coat on my back belongs to that rascal george washington and i do not know when he may take a fancy to order me out of it my soul is not my own he drinks my my tobacco and takes my clothes before my face as likely as not he will have on this very waistcoat before the week is out the major his well filled velvet as if he already felt the pangs of the approaching separation oh dear you me began miss yes madam i should be amazed myself except that i have stood it so long why i had once an affair with an intimate and valued friend judge you may have heard of him a very distinguished man and i was enough to carry that rascal george washington to the field thinking of course that i ought to go like a george washington s last and although the affair was arranged after we had taken our positions and i did not have the pleasure of shooting at him j good heavens exclaimed miss the pleasure of shooting at your friend monstrous i i say i did not have that pleasure corrected the major the affair was as i stated arranged without a shot yet do you know that rascal george washington will not allow that it was so and i understand he with the most details the manner in which he and i as he terms it shot my friend â murdered him miss gave an horrible what she said almost under her breath the major caught the words yes madam it is horrible to think of such unquestionably he deserves death but what can one do the law kept feeble by does not permit one to kill them however worthless they are he observed miss s start â except of course by way of example under certain peculiar circumstances as i have stated to you he bowed george washington s last miss was speechless so lie pursued i have sometimes been tempted to make a break for liberty and have thought that if i could once get the rascal on the field with my old pistols i would settle with him which of us is the master do you mean that you would â would shoot him gasped miss yes madam unless he should be too quick for me replied the major â or should order me from the field which he probably would do the old lady turned and hastily left the room iii though miss after this regarded the major with renewed suspicion and confided to her niece that she did not feel at all safe with him the old gentleman was soon on the same terms with rose that he was on with margaret herself he informed her that he was just twenty five his last grass and that he never could would or should grow a year older he and his friend mr george washington s last at the table that he regarded himself as a candidate for s hand and had the ground and he informed her that as soon as he could bring himself to break an oath which he had made twenty years before never to address another woman he intended to propose to her rose who had lingered at the table a moment behind the other ladies ed the old fellow that he need fear no rival and that if he could not muster courage to propose before she left as it was leap year she would exercise her and propose herself the major with his hand on his heart as he held the door open for her vowed as rose swept past him her fine eyes dancing and her face with fun that he was ready that moment to throw himself at her feet if it were not for the difficulty of getting up from his knees a little later in the margaret was down among the rose bushes where had joined her after rose had executed that inexplicable feminine of denying herself to oppose a lover s request was leaning against a pillar pretending to talk to rose but listening more to the of song in margaret s rich voice or george washington s last to the laughter which floated up to them from the garden below suddenly he said abruptly i believe that fellow is in love with margaret rose insisted on knowing what ground he had for so peculiar an opinion on which he charged his friend with being one of those fellows who falls in love with every pretty girl on whom he lays his eyes and declared that he had done nothing but hang around margaret ever since he had come to the county what rose might have replied to this unexpected attack on one whom she reserved for her own especial torture cannot be recorded for the major suddenly appeared around the both the young people instinctively straightened up ah i you i catch you he cried his face glowing with you d better look out â honey catches a heap of flies and sticks mighty hard rose don t show him any mercy â kick him on him i am not honey said ,46
