considered handsome almost as soon as she knew anything it could not escape her ears even when she was about the parlor and the visitors at her mother s thought it no harm to voice their delight at her being the only child she might have been spoiled by the constant which she received but she had inherited a pride of another kind having acquired an idea that she was a person entitled to

wanted to make a start to do something no matter how little toward the object he fully believed was to be attained that evening while walking with miss for it was their frequent habit to go out of doors he found himself unconsciously taking her hand that hand for which he had until now felt a genuine fright and she after all her resolutions never to permit anything of the sort gave it to him as they strolled together along an want so much to make a name he was saying fervently i have tried and tried to begin such a book as mr wants but i cannot won t you help me dear miss won t you show me

away she did not like that idea her book was not yet finished for one thing and besides he was a nice young fellow and had meant no there is no reason why you should go she stammered i forgive you i am sure do you cried grasping her hand again in his joy you are kindness itself to say so i must appear very stupid here he half put his arm around her again checking himself with difficulty from the movement and dull and wanting in manners but you are the only young lady i have ever known on terms of the least intimacy miss replied that she did not mind what had occurred and hoped he would forget it she added holding her hand that she would do anything she could for him and had the most earnest wish that they should be friends at the gate they paused and in some way their eyes were looking into each other the girl laughed a relief to feelings that had been for the past ten minutes somewhat well you have made a beginning she said for she wanted to drive the sober expression from his clouded face a beginning he echoed yes she said you have held my hand he you said you would forgive me he murmured with all my heart she responded putting the hand in his again he felt a thrill go through him but it was a pleasant sensation i came very near putting my arm around you said he looking away from her do you forgive that too she took the hand away and struck him on the cheek with the palm of it then before he what she intended she ran brightly up the steps of the house and vanished a black chapter ix my darling it was s full intention to say something about this adventure to his in the art of love mr but somehow he was not able to summon the requisite courage he had a delicate sense that such a thing ought not to be repeated where it might by any possibility bring a laugh and about this time the s attention began to be attracted toward the younger sister who had till then almost entirely escaped his observation he noticed particularly the ceaseless devotion that the black servant of the family exhibited toward her she might have been a goddess and he a a queen and he her slave moved about the girl like her very shadow ready to anticipate her slightest wants while seemed to take this excess of attention as a matter of course constantly showed her dislike for the servant i don t see how you can endure to have him touch you she said to he knows better than to lay his hands on me i have told papa often that i want him discharged and he ought to consider my wishes a little to this answered that the boy as she persisted in calling the giant meant well and was

steward while determined not to with matters that belonged to another could not help bringing his legal mind to bear on the case before him from the concluding statement of his friend he gathered that and the lady with him were unmarried he had not said so definitely but he had spoken of it as an assumption a thousand conjectures might be made of their reasons for under a false title there was certainly nothing to show that s marriage with miss had been broken off or even that this voyage with mrs had anything to in it of a nature still as he kept saying to himself whatever the affair meant it was nothing to him he could not undertake to act as guardian of the morals of a universe the world was a queer one and strange things happened every day half an hour later being in the dining saloon he was spoken to by the steward mr has asked me to give him and his wife their marriage bond ill eats next to you and the gentlemen who had them have consented kindly to make a change that will be very pleasant stammered mr involuntarily he glanced at the card which the steward had placed by the two plates and read them mr cabin mrs cabin the lunch bell rang while he was thinking about the matter and he himself for the ordeal before him to his relief however came to the table alone with the explanation that mrs did not yet feel equal to sitting up and would be served in her cabin margaret was not really ill but exhausted with the strain through which she had passed in her excited state she was already sorry that she had yielded to the temptation to follow the man she loved into the new world still she trembled to think how she would have felt at this moment had his vessel disappeared across the and left her to face the hopeless future of poverty alone the emotions dealt severely with a none too strong and the girl lay prone upon the sofa in her cabin a very pitiable object why had she ever left in his company she asked herself a thousand times there was the point to separate as her conscience had told her plainly every hour spent together made the parting more and more painful why had she to her great love at the hotel instead of making it easier to part either for her or him it had made it infinitely more difficult and here she was as his wife living a lie but on the other hand her situation had been indeed trying when she had resolved to give up so much for the sake of that american woman whom she had never seen she had need of something to strengthen her their marriage bond heart a single happy memory to the the after years of her life must hold she had stolen nothing from miss mr would marry yet at the hour he had agreed she would make him do it the ten days before he reached land were hers she might have taken all the days he had hut she had reserved to herself only this space giving all the rest to her rival on the second day at evening she appeared at dinner and ran the of many eyes as the probable bride who had come aboard at she was presented to mr who sat next to mr and exchanged a few words with him decided that he could tell nothing about her yet and waited to get a better opportunity to form an opinion she was certainly a pretty woman though he reflected had nothing of the radiant beauty of miss she wore mourning which added to the subdued appearance that had become natural to her she looked as if she had passed through some recent trial the of her face might be ascribed partly to this and partly to the effect of a day at sea when the dinner was ended margaret walked for half an hour on the deck leaning on her husband s arm and the most of the passengers satisfied their curiosity regarding her at that time then she retired and mr went to th smoking room to light a cigar the days that followed were much like this one though miss rivers was more upon the deck than at first she had little conversations with mr in which he learned that she was of english birth and had lived much in the east but nothing

looked at her she saw that he was not over pleased at the encounter he replied politely but there was a lack of cordiality in his manner that he perhaps did not realize good morning mrs he said
