him steadily sufficient for practical purposes well that would answer i didn t mean to go absolutely alone of course i meant it would be a nice thing to do if who can talk was to go with me well i hope you ve been enough they took the again and the looked up to see what direction they were to go said to her brother in a half sulky way that mr thought they ought to join the rest of their party and as it made no difference to him he nodded an assent taking this for an agreement on that question directed the men to turn about other were asked as they trotted past where the foreigners from the grand hotel were and they soon found them a little way out into the country with his usually slow brain had not at once caught the full significance of miss van s suggestion as to a journey into the interior when it came to him his breath grew shorter and his head felt faint what a dream it would be to take that lovely being under his protection through the wonderful scenery of the mountain regions guiding her to the views watching her bright eyes open with wonder as the magnificent unfolded no one there to witness her delight but he no one else on whom she could rely for direction and care and then almost as soon as the picture had itself it dissolved a princess madness mere madness when would he learn that he was a poor travelling companion to mr and that she was the daughter of the richest when would he realize that the difference between them was greater than that between and her island home across the pacific in speaking of taking him as her sole escort he believed miss van had revealed to the full the place he occupied in her mind he was to her merely a servant something a little better educated and intelligent perhaps but no more to be regarded than the who would draw her or lead her pony if this were not the case she would not talk to him like that when the party returned to the hotel for lunch mrs van the ride a success she had seen enough other ladies in the same sort of vehicle to relieve her from worry on the score of propriety to be sure it was impossible that many of them could hold quite as high a position in life as she did that lot was given to but few mortals but she was satisfied that she had done nothing from the of mrs in the course of the ride they had met the of and his friends to whom she had never succeeded by the way in being introduced and she had bowed with becoming dignity when the gentlemen formally lifted their hats they could not have been ten days on the without knowing who she was and the lady congratulated herself on this entrance into the exclusive circles of foreign nobility a sugar princess the main difficulty during the ride had been tc suppress within reasonable limits the noisy of mrs young s charming children the satisfied air with which the mother heard their shouts and witnessed their even exceeded the disgust on the faces of the others the children made common cause whenever opportunity availed against poor mr apparently on the ground that he was a natural and eminent enemy of their family though what he had done to deserve this treatment did not in the least appear it was a sight to witness the soft smile with which he met their most impertinent and the courteous way in which he tried to or to answer their questions an temple which the party visited set master angel wild with delight he entered with the others staring with wide open mouth at the grotesque images before whom a dozen were prostrate what a lot of blind people there are in this country remarked in a low tone what did you expect angel demanded don t you know your the heathen in their blindness bow down to wooden stone say what s wooden stone anyway i think you mean wood and stone suggested mrs young pleasantly no he insisted it s wooden stone you read it that way on sunday at the service didn t you e i mean mr bow down to wooden stone a sugar princess yes sir anyway there s no stone here it s all wood perhaps they think its wooden stone though he added because they re blind then he gave a loud yell caused by bringing his head into collision with a wooden post had made a pass at him on purpose to make him and receive the blow a rush across the room on his part and an attempt of hers to escape succeeded this effort and then several broke the quiet of the place on coming out of the temple two large wooden gods at the entrance which the children had not noticed before claimed their united attention these images had particularly faces and their bodies were nearly covered with what are usually called and which i do not know how to describe with any more delicate term the of these believe the most effective way to offer their prayers is to write them on paper them up and throw the against these wooden sides if the sticks it is believed the petition has been received if it falls the contrary interpretation is given to the incident angel and got so interested in these images that they could hardly be dragged off to their they resisted when their mother urged them to ,1

alone with those we love and yet though one would think there must be much to say and many things to explain neither made the least reference to the great subject that occupied their minds they talked of the scenery and the climate even of far off there are thoughts too deep for utterance and both were well content to all explanations to a future day before reaching the overtook them and they their

waited and watched her she must either enter one of the houses on this short way or return it was soon evident that she was going to pursue the latter course for she showed signs of surprise when she reached the end of the street and discovered that it went no farther she came back slowly and when she reached mr there were no other persons within hearing i beg your pardon miss he said in a pleasant voice and stepping in front of her may i speak to you for a moment it was the first time she had noticed him for her eyes had been fastened upon the pavement during most of her walk she looked up with a startled surprise a glance told her that he was a very well dressed gentleman and her natural instinct whispered that he could want nothing good of her i do not know you she responded in a trembling voice you have no right to address me she resumed her walk more rapidly than before but who knew the lessons of street acquaintance by heart was not in the least discouraged by the he followed after her murmuring in the sweetest voice that she ought not to him that she had his highest respect and that if she would give him but a minute he would prove the assertion it was a sight familiar enough in most cities as the pair on their journey through the streets they were observed by more than one who stopped and surveyed them with an air of amusement the girl was walking fast with her face turned from the their marriage bond man at her side whose nothing from the manner in which his addresses were received the increased as the girl he home laughter came from various groups at the spectacle created but the feather that was to break the hack of the came when a half drunken from the against which he had been leaning and put his hand on the girl s shoulder while he shouted a wholly invitation in her ear the girl stopped as if she had been shot and shook with fear the disagreeable quality of mr s were as nothing compared with this assault his tones had at least been kindly his words those of a gentleman in the in which she wag now placed she turned instinctively to him for protection from the greater danger oh sir was all she could articulate but her wish was clearly understood taking the by the whirled him around like a top ending by leaving him in a heap on the pavement luckily the fellow found no sympathy from his companions who seemed rather pleased than otherwise at his seeing that the coast was now clear and that an opportunity wholly unexpected had placed the young woman under obligations to him drew her not unwilling arm through his own and lost no time in putting a good distance between them and the late collision i thank you very much indeed said the feminine when they were safely away from the place and now if you please leave me here

afraid of me as you were of that rascal below i am a gentleman and have lived in boston all my life i wonder what there is about me that makes you want to run away do i really look such a terrible villain she stole another glance at him and was partially reassured by the engaging smile on his countenance it is not that sir she stammered but there is nothing in common between a poor girl like me and an elegant gentleman like you if you wish to do me a real kindness you will leave me here to be insulted by another drunken be exclaimed no i must see you safely home it is you are not used to the treatment you have just received i judge that you are a stranger in boston in spite of herself she was being drawn into to his proposition and she felt herself growing less and less afraid ts i have not lived here long she responded her walk i do not know the streets very well i only left my room to breathe the air with no errand in view he laughed brightly t how remarkable he said f that is exactly my own case i had spent the whole day indoors and felt the necessity of a stroll do you live far here no she named the street j think it is only five minutes i can find it sir alone and i am sure no one will me now but he would not listen the street to which she was bound he said was on the direct road he was obliged to take and it was best that they go together at the doorway of a poor lodging house she stopped and announced that this was where she lived their marriage bond the extreme poverty of the surroundings would ordinarily have prevented a wish to go farther but there was something about this girl that made mr especially loth to leave her does your family live here he asked surveying the front of the house i have no family she replied i am all alone the sympathy

to be some who will surely repeat conventional phrases pick up set phrases with surprising ease and will offer them whenever they have reason to believe such will be received instead of real coin these are easily recognized and they should be dealt with anything except that weapon which ia forbidden to the being legitimate against such cant the student who a set phrase is usually effectually disposed of by a request to explain to make clear and to prove so that the habit of repetition cannot grow unless the teacher is to it the genuine ideas of the pupils may be developed and put into word in the class and afterwards the writing oat will involve getting them into order and logical it may be objected that by thia process each scholar will borrow ideas from what he hears said in the class this is in reality no serious to the method if the individuals are trained to think for themselves each will judge the views which are presented in class and make them his own by and them in any case the danger of a student s getting too many ideas is not large and those he gets from his his are much more likely to appeal to him and to remain in hb mind than any which he from books the notions will sometimes be crude but they will be so corrected and discussed in that they cannot be essentially false talks on teaching literature any criticism which ia received from pupils whether spoken or written must first of all be in sound sense la tlie only safe basis w any and the higher the grade of a work of literature the more easy is it to treat it in a common sense spirit pupils â should be made to feel not only that they have a right to any opinion of their own on what they read but that they are expected to have one and that this opinion may be of any nature whatever bo long as they can justify it by sound reasons still farther than this they should be allowed freely to cherish tastes for which they cannot give formal justification â provided they can show a reasonable appreciation of the real qualities of the work they like or dislike in the higher regions imaginative work the power of analysis of the most able critic may fail and it is idle to expect from school children criticism of high things which yet they may feel deeply since it is of so much importance that all comment and criticism shall be sincere care must be taken to keep work within limits which make sincerity possible students must not be required to perform tasks which are in the nature of things impossible to push beyond dealing with comparatively simple matters in a frank and direct manner inevitably to encourage the use of conventional phrases and to replace sincerity with cant a nice question itself with the determination of how much it is proper and wise to re â t a criticism of children it is how much farther it is well to call upon them to literature than we should ask them to on life we need to know wh t we are doing and though an examination of the character and motives of a criminal in a hook is not the same as would be this sort of applied to a flesh and blood neighbor the two processes are the in essence the better the teacher in the imagination of the pupil moreover the more closely the two approach we should be sure that we axe doing well in requiring oâ the young who would not and should not be encouraged to dwell on actual crime and suffering that they produce original upon these things as represented in action it is of course to be allowed that no teaching can make actions vital and real in exactly the same way as is that which is known actually to have happened an imaginative child the story which touches him but does not bring it home to himself as he would within the circle of his own experience it may be urged that by ng him to sin in the comparatively remote world of fancy we give him a chance to perceive its moral without that distrust of hb fellows which might come if he were forced to the lesson from the of life and that in hooks the knowledge of character and circumstance is so much fuller than it is likely to be in experience that he is able talks on teaching literature to see more clearly the fact remains however that we should hardly expect or desire a and reasonable estimate of the late king and queen of from the school who are being made to write laborious on the motives and the character of and lady that we should be shocked at finding boys and girls considering in real life like the of or suspicions like those entertained of we certainly cannot afford to be or to confine the young to books they may generally be safely trusted it seems to me to read any tale or poem of first merit although its subject e as painful as that of they will receive it as they receive of life told by a wholesome minded

3,314,to the opinions of his elders to view life from their more point of view and inevitably to receive a fresh and not always a desirable insight into evil i am not inclined to on this point and touch upon it chiefly for the sake of suggesting that teachers may do well to keep it a little in each case it seems to me must be criticism decided upon its own merit and i at least have ao arbitrary rules to lay down of one thing however i am sure and that is that whatever is taken up at be treated with h and fearless of style or whatever belongs to literary necessarily comes late in the secondary schools i believe very little can be done in this line at all of this i shall later in connection with the study of but here i may say that i suppose most teachers to recognize the obvious absurdity of such questions about and effects as are given on page that they should be gravely proposed in a book of advice is indication that somebody believes in them but any class of students with which i have ever had to deal would be reduced to mechanical repetition of cant by the bare sight of such one thing which ia of importance is the need of encouraging pupils to judge of any as a i whole it is so much easier to deal with details a than with a complete work that constantly students leave schools where the training is in many respects excellent and have gained no ability to go beyond the examination of particulars the far more important power of a book or a play from its total effect has not been cultivated no teacher should forget that the ability to deal fairly with a whole is of as more value than any r talks on teaching literature facility in minute as that whole is greater than any of it i parts this does not mean that a student can well everything he reads or that he may wisely attempt it it does imply that at least his attention shall have been lt d over and over to the great fact that the study of details is not the study of a that he shall have been required to judge a book or a play so far as he is able as a whole with reference to its entire effect in talking with even about short works pieces no longer than a single essay of or a simple i constantly find that they are apt to have no conception whatever that they could or should do anything but pick out minute details i ask what it to as a whole how it itself or what is its value as a complete poem or essay and they seem unable to see what i am driving at the painful attempt to find out what wish them to say so entirely their minds as to render them incapable of using whatever power of judgment they may possess not long ago one boy said to me i did n t know it made any difference what the poem was about if you could pick out things in it what do you suppose it was written for i asked a look of painful bewilderment came into his face and he answered that he supposed some folks liked to write that way i inquired whether he would test a bridge â he was an student â by picking out bits without seeing how the parts held and how it was as a whole and he returned with puzzled frankness i but a bridge has a use very good was what i assured him and so does a poem can t you appreciate that mankind has not been keeping poems from generation to generation without finding out if they really are useless any work of literature that ia really good must be of value as a whole and you have not got hold of it until you are able to see it ia for aa a single thing a complete the fact is so evident that it seems almost absurd to mention it in a book intended for teachers but scores of boys come yearly fi om the fitting who prove bow often the fact is ignored â ignored very likely because it is taken for granted but no less ignored with seriously ill effects in general criticism in the v have to do only with the good points of work unless a pupil himself shows that he in what is read it is on the whole the place of the to keep the attention of the class fixed on merits while defects are ignored this is not to be interpreted as meaning that any weakness should ever be allowed to pass for a merit or as indicating that it is ever wise to a any intelligent pupil for instance should see for himself that the are sadly and mixed in the passage whether tis in thâ mind to the aod of fortune or to take arms a sea of and by opposing end them talks on teaching it is necessary to meet this knowledge frankly and to show him how it is that can be bo great in spite of faults like this it is the inclination of childhood to feel that a man must be perfect to be great but even at the coat of the difficulty of such a faith the truth must be told in general however it is as well not to go out of the way to enforce the doctrine of human and the mind is best by being fed on what ia good rather than by being taught to perceive what ia bad when a pupil ia asked to put into words the reason why a piece is written he should be required to answer by a complete sentence a properly ,3

brown handed upright as your pines by the scale of a shape your designs is an inspiring programme for the and the but how are you to be brown handed in a city office what if you never see the upright pines how are you to have so big a purpose on so small a part of the as it has grown old unquestionably the east has grown there is no suggestion of the in its city streets or of the and farmer in its well dressed men its ports with shipping from europe and the indies its newspapers run upon the of an old world it hears of the great plains of the continent as of foreign parts which it may never by l o o think to see except from a car window its life is self and selfish the west save where special interest as in those pockets of silver where men s eyes catch as it were an eager gleam from the very ore itself â the west is in less danger of who shall say in that wide country where one region ends and another begins or in that free and changing society where one class ends and another this

pacific and now the plot turn upon their old paths fill in the spaces they passed by neglected in their first journey in search of a land of promise settle to a life such as the east knows as well as the west â nay much better with the change the pause the settlement our people draw into closer groups stand face to face to know each other and be known and the time has come for the east to learn in her turn to her understanding of political and conditions to the scale of a as her own poet bade let us be sure that we get the national temperament send our minds abroad upon the continent become neighbors to all the people that live upon it and lovers of them all as was read but your history aright and you shall not find the task too hard your own local history look but deep enough tells the tale you must take to heart here upon our own as truly as ever in the west was once a national frontier with an elder east beyond the seas here too various combined and elements separated elsewhere effected a and wholesome mixture here too the national stream flowed full and strong bearing a thousand things upon its currents let us resume and keep the vision of that time know ourselves our

not unused to be that his footsteps might be dogged it was then that saw his face as his eyes lowered on the people behind him in the without particularly resting upon s face or any other he had scarcely turned his head about again and it was still bent down listening to the girl when the ceased and the stream of people flowed on still bending his head and listening to the girl he went on at her side and followed them resolved to play this unexpected play out and see where they went he had hardly made the determination though he was not long about it when he was again as suddenly brought up as he had been by the they turned short into the â the girl evidently leading â and went straight on as if they were going to the terrace which the river there is always to this day a sudden pause

the strange man as they went down the street the man s footsteps were so noisy on the echoing stones that he was unwilling to add the sound of his own but when they had passed the turning and were in the darkness of the dark corner leading to the terrace he made after them with such indifferent appearance of being a casual passenger on his way as he could assume when he rounded the dark corner they were walking along the terrace towards a figure which was coming towards them if he had seen it by itself under such conditions of gas lamp mist and distance he might not have known it at first sight but with the figure of the girl to prompt him he at once recognised miss little he stopped at the comer seeming to up the street as if he had made an appointment with some one to meet him there but he kept a careful eye on the three when they came together the man took off his hat and made miss a bow the girl appeared to say a few words as though she presented him or accounted for his being late or early or what not and then fell a pace or so behind bv herself miss and the man then began to walk up and down the man having the appearance of being extremely courteous and complimentary in manner miss having the appearance of being extremely haughty when they came down to the corner and turned she was saying if i pinch myself for it sir that is my business confine yourself to yours and ask me no question by heaven ma am he replied making her another bow it was my profound respect for the strength of your character and my admiration of your beauty i want neither the one nor the other

folded before her and that was all he could make of her without showing his face there happened by good fortune to be a really waiting for some one and he sometimes looked over the railing at the water and sometimes came to the dark corner and looked up the street rendering arthur less conspicuous when miss and the man came back again she was saying you must wait until to morrow a thousand he returned my faith then it s not convenient to night no i tell you i must get it before i can give it to you she stopped in the as if to put an end to the conference he of course stopped too and the

with and had departed on the day which found measuring the length of the library she and mrs had the to themselves and it was hardly a surprise to her when in the course of the afternoon mrs after a discreet pause on the threshold advanced toward ber down the long room m i the fruit of the tree since the night of her return had felt sure that mrs would speak but the elder lady was given to hawk

invalid cousin to go to europe with her next week and i can t go without being at peace about our friends she paused but made no answer in spite of her growing sympathy for mrs she could not overcome an inherent distrust not of her methods but of her ultimate object what for instance was her conception of being at peace about the s own conviction was that as far as their final welfare was

embarrassment increased would it not be both to and to acknowledge to a third person a fact of which herself was unaware yet to betray embarrassment under mrs s eyes was to risk giving it a dangerous

being cut oflf from his work at yes â so i think but that is a difficulty that time and must all we can do â their friends i mean â is to get them together again before the breach is too wide pondered she was perhaps more ignorant of the situation than mrs imagined for since her talk with the latter had not again alluded to s absence and could merely conjecture that he had carried out his plan of taking the management of the mill he had spoken of what she most wished to know was whether he had listened to her entreaty and taken the position temporarily without binding himself by the acceptance of a or whether wounded by the outrage of s flight he had freed himself from financial dependence by engaging himself definitely as manager i really know very little of the present said looking at mrs merely told me that mr had taken up his old work in a cotton mill in the south as her met mrs s it flashed across her that the latter did not believe what she said and the the fruit of the tree

sir francis the best of all the early of virginia had set forth in an elaborate report that the principal cause of the slow proceeding of the growth of the plantation was that the government had been divided between england and virginia escaped from this embarrassment x the of the government may now be traced through its several stages a company was formed partly of men but chiefly of of london this company secured a patent to lands in bay from the council for new england the intended both a commercial enterprise and a settlement they sent one of their number as agent or with a company of servants and others to prepare the way for the of other in march they secured a liberal from the king which gave them the right to establish in a government subordinate to the company the plan was to settle a government in the form rendered familiar by that of the virginia company the company in london sent a commission to as governor on the place subject to the orders of the company in england a council of was associated with him chap iv s may z of the chap s the book ii note the change of plan but there was as yet no provision for giving the people a voice in the government and his of gentlemen appear to have been dissatisfied with the prospect of living under a government directed from england and thus subject to english and liable to interference from the court had been a leader and the most liberal in the enterprise he no doubt readily foresaw the great advance that the colony would make if and his friends should their lives and fortunes in it and he may have intended to

there could hardly be a doubt that the would be as soon as its should develop their true purpose before the all observing eyes of who was now rising rapidly to dominant influence in the government it was at this juncture probably that conceived his ingenious plan he would resign his place and have the officers of the company chosen from gentlemen about to for the plantation the prescribed no place of to the company which had been left free apparently to make its at its in or at its new home in london it was also free to meet in any other the great place the meetings of the company might therefore be held in where the of its proceedings would attract less attention the governor and other officers would then be chosen in the colony the company and the colony would thus be into one and the transported to would perhaps be beyond the reach of and judgments xi no doubt the influential company of friends who were a removal to new england were informed of s proposition before it was in the company on the th of july the plan was probably thought of in consequence of their objection to under the virginia system s proposition was at least the turning point of their decision nearly a month later on the th of august the leaders of s party assembled to the number of twelve at cambridge and solemnly pledged themselves in the presence of god who is the of all hearts to pass the seas under god s protection to and continue in new england the states the object of this it was not civil liberty the end that political had most in view and certainly there is no hint of a desire for religious liberty even the of the indian is not uppermost in this solemn resolve god s glory and the church s good are the words used this has the true ring chap iv the bridge agreement i a b io the

only on condition that the whole government together with the patent for said plantation should be transferred and established in the colony by order of the general court of the company and that this should be done before the last of the month there was opposition to the removal of the government and this condition was necessary three days later after a debate the company that its government should be transferred to bay on the th of october resigned his and was chosen in his stead ministers were at once elected to the freedom of the company in order that its proceedings might not want the

authority almost as wild as the savages they formed a race of men who made successful in the indian wars famous in the revolution and daring when the country beyond the mountains came to be settled deer were caught in iron traps large enough to be mâ ii dangerous to men sometimes a hunter himself in a deer skin so as to creep up near to a herd of these timid creatures horses were trained to walk

12,1047,before he could collect his wits a message came that he was wanted by jove it s george he said and hurried out of the room mrs overheard the name i suppose hb friend is called george mrs receives is thought and frowned her recollections of that name were not pleasant however she thought no more about the matter but mr for his to the it is so sweet of mrs to play it i beg beg pardon putting away his envelope and looking up with a dreamy eye i was a new i hope to make my fortune out of it madame smiled she had heard that prophecy before but poor s inventions had never succeeded in getting him the house in park lane he was always dreaming about but she patted his shoulder and then sailed across to miss bull the music doesn t please you miss bull she said in rather an tone it s very nice the old maid the cards but i have heard the before you may not have the chance of hearing it again said madame miss bull shrugged her shoulders to signify that it did not matter i suppose that means mrs is about to leave us she said there may be changes in the soon miss bull it s a world of change replied miss bull in her sharp voice was that a heart pointed a fat finger to the card in question and miss bull muttered something about her getting worse madame knew that this was just done to annoy her as miss bull s sight was excellent to revenge herself she took away go and tell the servants to send up the and she said sharply rose heavily she was a huge girl of twenty years of age and apparently very stupid the yellow why sharp little miss bull who loved no one had taken to her no one knew but the two were inseparable seeing this madame usually kept hard at work in other quarters so as to part her from the old maid but with the of an and was very much of that the girl managed to see a great deal of her one friend madame had an idea of the reason for this but at the present moment did not think it was necessary to interfere she was quite capable of crushing miss bull when the need arose meantime she her temper by sending away the girl departed with a and an angry look at her aunt but miss bull never raised her eyes though she was well aware of what was going on madame was not to be beaten i tell you what dear miss bull she said smiling graciously since you have broken through our rule and have produced the cards you shall tell all our fortunes yours asked miss bull looking up for the first time madame shook her head i know mine tell mr if his invention will succeed or perhaps mr i am at miss bull s service said the polite old gentleman bowing miss bull swept the cards into a heap fm quite willing she said in a voice almost pleasant for her anything to oblige dear madame mrs smiled still more graciously and sailed away to send mr to the cards but she wondered inwardly why miss bull had given way so suddenly there was some reason for it as miss bull never did anything without a reason but mrs kept her own counsel and still continued to smile she had quite made up her mind how to act ladies and gentlemen she said standing in mrs receives the middle of the drawing room we must to night at ten i have some business to attend to so i request you will all retire at that hour in the mean time miss bull has kindly consented to tell your fortunes it was extraordinary to see how those withered old people crowded round the table their several had long since been settled so what they could expect the cards to tell them save that they would one and all die soon it is difficult to say yet so is the wish to know the future in the human breast that they were as eager as youth to hear what would befall them and miss bull wholly unmoved by their excitement dealt the cards with the air of a madame meantime retired to her throne and saw that the servants arranged the tray properly she had a gigantic chair which was called her throne and here she received strangers in quite a majestic way it was a sort of lady reception on a small scale as mr assured her and as he had been to house in hid youth he knew what he was talking about knowing his manners and being greedy of compliments mrs always tried to make him say that she resembled lady but this mt refused to do not that mrs was bad looking she had a fresh colored face bright black eyes and plenty of white hair like spun silk her figure was stout but she yet retained a certain which showed that she must have been a handsome woman in her youth her manners were but she showed a stern face toward and did not treat the girl so kindly as she might have done as a rule she had great but sometimes gave way to of passion which were really but mar the yellow alone had been witness of these and mrs passed for a dear gentle old lady mr is to be married announced mrs leaving the the card table how extraordinary so extraordinary that it can t possibly be true said mr unless madame will accept me he added bowing i should miss bull replied madame very sweetly but with a note in her voice she might as well have thought to rouse the dead for miss bull paid not the attention ,12
12,1048,and there so far as the evidence went was an end to the strange tenant of the silent house link the charged with the conduct of the case confessed as much to i do not see the slightest chance of tracing s past said he to the we are as ignorant about him as we are of the name of the are you sure there is no clue mr link absolutely none even the weapon with which the crime was committed cannot be found you have searched the house every inch of it and with the result that i have found nothing the surroundings of the case are most mysterious if we do not identify the dead we hope to trace the murderer how the wretch got into the house is more than i can discover it is strange admitted thoughtfully yet in some secret way people were in the habit of entering the house and knew as much not only that but he protected them from curiosity by denying that they even existed i don t quite follow you mr i allude to the shadows on the blind which i saw myself a week before the murder took place they were those of a man and a woman and must have been cast by bodies of flesh and blood therefore two people must have been in s sitting room on that night yet when i met â the silent house who was absent at the time â he denied that anyone could have entered his house without his knowledge more he actually insisted that i should satisfy myself as to the truth of this by examining the house which you did yes but found nothing yet said with an air of conviction however the man and woman entered they were in the house then the must have come in by the same way but where that way can be or how it can be found is more than i can say does the landlord know of any secret passages no i asked him replied the but he stated that houses nowadays were not built with secret passages when denied that anyone was in the house was he afraid mr yes he seemed to be nervous and he told you he had enemies he hinted that there were people who wished to see him dead from the way he spoke and the language he used i am satisfied that he was hiding from the vengeance of some one vengeance repeated link raising his eyebrows is not that word a trifle perhaps but to my mind there is more in actual life than people fancy however mr link added i have come to certain conclusions that was in hiding secondly that he saw people secretly who entered in the silent house some way we cannot discover and that to solve the problem it will be necessary to look into the past life of the dead man your third conclusion brings us round to the point whence we started retorted link how am i to discover the man s past by learning who he is and what is his real name an easy task said the considering the meagre material upon we have to work and how is the business to be accomplished by advertisement advertisement yes i wonder the idea did not strike you before seeing how often it is used in similar cases a full description of the man who called himself note his physical peculiarities and looks and such description by means of and newspapers link looked angry and laughed rather contemptuously as his professional pride was touched by the fact of being advised by an individual not of his calling i am not so ignorant of my business as you think he said sharply what you suggest has already been done there are describing the appearance of in every police office in the kingdom in the newspapers also asked by the s tone the silent house no it is not necessary i don t agree with you many people in private life are not likely to see your i don t pretend to advise mr link he added in soothing tones but would it not be wise to use the medium of the daily papers i ll think of it said link too jealous of his dignity to give way at once oh i quite rely on your discretion said hastily you know your own business best but if you succeed in will you let me know link looked keenly at the young man why do you wish to know about the matter he asked out of simple curiosity the case is so mysterious that i should like to watch you it well said link rather gratified by this tribute to his power i shall indulge your fancy the result of this conversation was that observed in the newspapers next day an advertisement describing the looks and name and physical peculiarities of the deceased with special mention of the loss of the left hand s little finger and the strange on the right cheek satisfied that the only way to learn the truth had been adopted by the authorities impatiently waited for the development of the scheme within the week he received a visit from the you were right and i was wrong mr the silent house admitted link generously the newspapers were of more use than the yesterday i received a letter from a lady who is coming to see me to morrow at my office so if you care to be present at the interview you have only to say so i should like it above all things said eagerly who is the lady a mrs who writes from bath can she identify the dead man she thinks she can but of course she cannot be certain until she sees the body going by the description however added link she is inclined to believe that was ,12

attitude during the interview to that which he would have assumed had the young man been uncouth and in place of this unexpected arrival who had a use for the youth rather congratulated himself on the trick of fate moreover the descriptions given by madam and the doctor interested him in no small degree for he found it difficult to reconcile the statement that was a gentleman and a public school boy with the fact that he the country as an on the instant this ex a mystery and it was therefore with no little curiosity that he repaired after dinner to the study of dr for the purpose of conversing with his guest in reality regarded himself as a prisoner which opinion would have considerably surprised the courteous old lord had he known of it for notwithstanding the abrupt entrance and lowly pro the dwarf s chamber of the youth the mere fact that two such excellent judges as madam and considered him to be of gentle birth to regard him in the light of a guest still in his poor

15,1363,for the instruction of the multitude and not because the nature of man is as god s nature and on second thoughts he added nor must it be forgotten that the book of was written when we were a wandering tribe come out of the desert of without towns or cities without a temple without an ark â ours having fallen into the hands of the he continued his till held up his hand and asked s permission to speak the words that had been quoted from those in which the speak of god as if he were a man to him the acts and motives of man were addressed as our reader has pointed out to men who had hardly advanced beyond the intelligence of childhood whose minds were still simple and unable to receive any idea of god except the primitive notion that god is a greater man now the reason for my interruption is this i should like to point out that for those who have passed beyond this stage whose intelligence is not limited to their imagination and whose will is not governed by selfish fears and hopes there the brook is another lesson in the words we can rise to the consciousness of god as an absolute being of whom we know only that he is and not what he is and this is what is meant when god is spoken of by the name i am that i am was minded to speak begged of him not to withhold his thoughts but to speak them and it was at this moment that paul entered walking softly lest his footsteps should interrupt whom he heard say that he with the last part of speech inasmuch as it would be against the word of the and likewise against all tradition to accept god as no more than the absolute substance which strictly taken would all differences and relation even the differences and relation of subject and object in self consciousness i shall not be lacking in appreciation of the wisdom of our learned brother paul heard him say if i venture to hold to the idea of a god whom we know at least to be conscious for he says i am a statement which had much interest for paul and while considering it he heard say it is hard to conceive of god except as a high principle of being and well being in the universe who all things to each other in binding them to himself then there are two gods and not one god interposed quickly an objection to which made this answer not two gods but two aspects thereby for the moment who muttered two aspects which have however to be reduced to unity paul s eyes went from to and he thought that face wore an expression of amused contempt as he listened and called upon other to contribute their small thoughts to the discussion encouraged by a wave of his hand ventured to remark there is god and there is the word of god to which murmured this reply there is only one god one who watches over his chosen people and over all the other nations of the earth s the brook but does god love the other nations as dearly as the hebrew people asked and answered him we may not so far into the love of god it being infinite but this we may say that it is through the hebrew people that god makes manifest his love of mankind on condition let it be understood of their obedience to his revealed will and if i may add a few words to the idea so suggested by our brother i would say that god is the substance out of which all things but these words must not be taken too literally thereby refusing to god a personal consciousness for god knows certainly all the differences and all the relations and we should all the teaching of scripture and lose ourselves in the errors of greek philosophy if we held to the belief of a god absolute pure simple detached from all concern with his world and his people but in what measure asked laying his upon his knees and leaning forward his long chin resting on his hand in what measure he asked speaking out of his deepest self are we to look upon god as a conscious being if could answer that question we should be grateful for it is the question which every in the solitude of his cell has any brother here a word to say now you brother i am sure there is a thought in your heart that we would all like to hear brother i call upon thee brother seemed to have no wish to speak but continued to press him saying brother for what else hast thou been seeking in thy but for a text whereon to base an argument and seeing that it was impossible for him to escape from the of argument brother answered that he took his stand upon do we not read that the lord thy god that before thee shall fight for thee and in the desert thou hast seen that he bore thee as a man bears his the brook sons all the way that ye went till ye came unto this place but interrupted has forgotten that one of the leading thoughts in this discourse is that the words in were written for starving tribes that came out of rather than for us

16,1467,humor in every form as well as that of the honest wrath which shakes many a noble sentence of english as a mighty man of war is shaken by her own is something wholly apart from the and which are treated as if they were real forces itself as the easy chair has often said has a certain power and to call a man a rascal to a hundred thousand persons at once produces an effect but we must not mistake it for what it is not being false it is not an effect which nor does it vex the equal mind it is the fact that the public often seems to demand that kind of to enjoy fury instead of force and ridicule instead of reason which s the inquiry whether if self restraint and wise discipline are desirable for every faculty of the and body the tongue and hand alone should be allowed to riot in wanton excess if even the legitimate must be handled like with extreme caution of every degree is a nuisance to be and by those who know the difference between grandeur and between and between fair play and foul september newspaper vi the easy chair has been asked whether there is any code of newspaper manners it has no doubt that there is but it is the universal code of courtesy and not one to newspapers good manners in civilized society are the same everywhere and in all relations a newspaper is not a mystery it is the work of several men and women and their manners in doing the work are subject to the same principles that govern their manners in society or in any other human relation if a man is a gentleman he does not cease to be one because he enters a newspaper office and it would seem to be equally true that if his work on the paper does not prove to be that of a gentleman it could not have been a gentleman who did the work a gentleman we will suppose does not his neighbors nor talk incessantly about himself and his achievements nor behave elsewhere as he would be ashamed to behave in his club or in his own family if a gentle man does not do these things of course a gentleman does not do them in a newspaper and does it not seem to follow if such things are done in a newspaper and are traced to a hand supposed to be that of a gentleman that there has been some mistake about the hand good manners are essentially a disposition which conduct they can be feigned indeed as gilt gold and plate silver but the glass is not diamond a man may smile and smile and be a villain are sometimes described as of gentlemanly manners and newspaper was not personally a but he was not a gentleman and he merely affected good manners a gentleman indeed may sometimes lose his temper or his self control but no one who habitually does it and and rails can be called properly by that name here again it is easy to apply the to a newspaper when a newspaper habitually takes an insulting tone and deliberately whether by assertion of an or by a and of the truth it is not the work of a gentleman and if the writer be responsible for the tone of the paper the manners of that newspaper are not good manners but there is no in newspaper manners as there is none elsewhere therefore it cannot be said that newspapers as a whole are either well or as you cannot say that men as a body are courteous or uncouth some newspapers are vulgar like some people they are not so of themselves however they are made vulgar by vulgar people there are very able newspapers which have very bad manners and some which have no other distinction than good manners a very dull man may be very and so may a very dull newspaper on the other hand a newspaper which is both brilliant and clever may be sometimes guilty of an injustice a deliberate and persistent to attain a particular end â conduct which is sometimes called but the person who is responsible for the performance for similar conduct would be kicked out of a club but gentlemen are not kicked out of clubs a newspaper gains neither character newspaper nor influence by good manners it may indeed make itself disagreeable and and so silence opposition as a may effectually close the wood path which you had designed to take it may be feared and in the same way as that animal â feared and despised but this effect must not be confounded with newspaper power and influence it is exceedingly undoubtedly to be all over town as a liar or a donkey a or a thief but although the effect is most unpleasant very little ability is required to produce it a little paper and a little a great deal of malice and a host of are all that are needed and even the pecuniary cost is not large the effect is produced but it does not show ability or force or influence upon the part of its the manners of newspapers as such cannot be any more than the manners of or of the professions or trades this however seems to be true that a well man will not produce an ill newspaper april the end s other times and other seasons by a little english gallery by literary and social by studies of the stage by and with other essays on other by as

another trick in the game for me because those eyes do not into my fancy how can they since does not know of my existence unless indeed she should remember the first time i saw her it was only last year in may i bad dined somewhat hastily in consideration of the fine day and of my confidence that many would be that afternoon i saw my comfortably engaged in the of our eldest boy â an economical care to which my darling is not unequal even in these days and in this town â and then hurried toward the avenue it is never much thronged at that hour the moment is sacred to dinner as i paused at the corner of twelfth street by the church you i saw an apple woman from whose stores i determined to finish my bv and which had been imperfect at home but of and economical i was not the man to pay prices for apples and while still with the wrinkled eve who had tempted me i became aware of a carriage approaching and indeed already close by i my eyes stiu an apple which i held in one hand while the other grasped my walking stick true to my instincts of dinner guests as young women to a passing wedding or old ones to a funeral and beheld old in this kind of observation as i am there was something so graciously in the look that she cast upon me as unconsciously indeed as she would have cast it upon the church that hastily for my spectacles to enjoy the boon more fully i advanced upon the and in some indescribable manner down we all fell into the street old woman apples baskets stand and i in confusion as i struggled there somewhat bewildered yet sufficiently self possessed to look after the carriage i beheld that beautiful woman looking at us through the back window you could not have done it the integrity of your shirt collar would have interfered and smiling pleasantly so that her going around the corner was like a gentle sunset bv dinner time so seemed she to disappear in her own smiling or â if you choose in view of the apple a rainbow after a storm if the beautiful that event she may know of my existence not otherwise and even then she knows me only as a funny old gentleman who in his eagerness to look at her tumbled over an apple woman my fancy from that moment followed her how grateful i was to the wrinkled eve s and to the tumble since it procured me the sight of tliat smile i took my sweet revenge from that for i knew that the beautiful entered the house of her host with beaming eyes and my fancy heard her sparkling story you consider yourself happy because you are sitting by her and helping her to a lady finger or a for which she smiles but i was her theme for ten mortal minutes she was my bard my historian she was the of my fall she set my to music in telling it think what it is to have inspired to have called a brighter beam into the eyes of and do not think so much of passing the my dear young friend there was the advantage of not going to that dinner had i been invited as you were i should bv and have about the buttons on my white waistcoat instead of leaving her placidly she would have been fearful of being too late of tumbling the garment of it fearful of offending me in some way admirable woman i in my natural impatience might have let drop a thoughtless word which would have been a pang in her heart and a tear in her eye for weeks afterward as i walked nervously up the avenue for i am to i should not have had that image of quiet and the as the back ground in the pictures of the gay figures i passed making each by contrast fairer i should have been wondering what to say and do at the dinner i should surely have been very warm and yet not have enjoyed the rich sunlight need i tell you that i should not have stopped for apples but instead of tumbling into the street with apples and whereby i merely rent my across the knee in a manner that can readily and at little coat repair i should beyond have split a new dollar pair of gloves in the effort of straining my hands into them which would also have caused me additional in the face and renewed fluttering bv time above all i should not have seen passing in her carriage nor would she have smiled at me nor charmed my memory with her radiance nor the circle at dinner with the sparkling of ray woes then at the table i should not have sat by her you would have had that pleasure i should have led out ,16
16,1469,wisdom let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the boxes t was a sage of the sex who after many years of experience remarked that men are queer that they are so in a positive sense no shrewd observer of mankind would deny but that they are so comparatively or absolutely would be a very hardy assertion if the queen of the household is of opinion that her associate majesty is very queer because he a height of the in the drawing room he holds probably a similar view of her fondness in the for what he describes as burnt beef a hopeless bachelor who himself upon what he called his freedom used to say with an air of and extreme caution that he supposed his married friends were probably what they called happy but he added that he never knew any of the happy pairs to agree upon the proper warmth of a room or the true turn of a roast or the just amount of fresh air still he said i do not assert that their matrimonial felicity was not great but the of the sage of the better sex that men are queer has been strongly confirmed by a recent decision of the authorities of the opera house in new york that important body producing the figures has announced in effect that as it is clear from the accounts that the of german opera is more profitable than that of italian and french opera combined it is evident that the public desires to hear italian and french opera and therefore for the present the german opera will be this is certainly delightful proof that men are queer and that one respected group of them by a signal display of are anxious to contribute to the of nations it is a striking illustration of the superiority of man to money and in the mad struggle for a mere material advantage this devotion to pure art the expense is a noble tribute to the of human nature another view has been advanced which is also interesting to the student of mankind it is put in this way that if the cost of the italian and french opera should be a hundred thousand dollars in a season more than that of the german yet it will be gladly paid by those of boxes who have an desire to proceed with their intellectual cultivation by audible conversation during the performance the argument is that these of the intellect hold that nothing is lost by not hearing the italian and french music and that the evening can be much more devoted to the conversation which takes place in an opera box still another view is even more honorable to the boxes while it does not the performance this view holds that the situation offers a choice of delights an embarrassment of riches charming and as the music may be yet still more lofty and f ing is the conversation and the boxes are therefore compelled to an alternative and very naturally and properly choose their own talk to the music the decision of the authorities may be consequently held to be designed to secure a of conversation in the boxes upon the lowest terms of loss this cannot but be regarded by a judicious public as a wise conclusion it is of course desirable that the wit and wisdom of the box chat should continue but at the least sacrifice and the least sacrifice seems to be considered the italian and french opera together with a certain sum of money upon these lowest terms every friend of humanity will be glad to know that the delights of the boxes will be it is even hinted also that there will be no disposition in an to hiss the interruption of italian and french opera if the boxes think fit upon intellectual grounds to accompany the dying falls of french and italian strains with a cheerful murmur of talk the will without a sense of loss if deed upon such occasions there should be any remaining the noble sacrifice of those public the boxes is still more strikingly illustrated by the fact that the italian opera in other countries as with us and that not only in england which has been the el of the artists of the southern school but in italy itself the opera of italy has declined the truth probably is that for some time in all cultivated countries italian opera which was a fashion was largely maintained as a social opportunity under conditions which most favored personal display and made the least intellectual demand it supplied also to the society in the boxes at the san the the the and her majesty s the entertainment in the persons of famous ma of an extraordinary performance the charm of that performance was the rippling and glittering of the sweet and tender melody of the sparkle of the romantic pathos of the brilliant strain of â none who have felt the spell will deny the enchantment but one age with its spirit and taste another a deeper stronger more earnest taste in music a higher general cultivation another theory of opera have come into the house and

18,1675,and to and threaten her majesty s loyal subjects with war and death the lesson was not lost on them but they postponed action till a more favourable opportunity sir before his departure took an opportunity at a public dinner given him at of assuring the loyal inhabitants of the country that the would never be given back meanwhile a new had arisen in egypt in the shape of sir and on the th june we find him communicating the fact to sir in very plain language telling him that he of his course of action with r ard to and that in future you will please take orders only from as soon as sir had completed his arrangements for the of he proceeded the under british in to and having caused himself to be sworn in as governor set vigorously to work i must say that in his dealings with the he showed great judgment and a keen appreciation of what the country needed namely strong government the fact of the matter being i suppose that being very popular with the home authorities he felt that he could more or less command their support in what he did a satisfaction not given to most who never know but that they may be thrown overboard in emergency to the ship one of his first acts was to issue a stating that whereas it appears that notwithstanding repeated assurances of contrary effect given by her majesty s representatives in this territory uncertainty or exists amongst some of her majesty s subjects as to the intention of her majesty s regarding the maintenance of british rule and over the territory of the and whereas it is expedient that all grounds for such uncertainty or should be removed once and for beyond doubt or question now therefore i do proclaim and make known in the name and on behalf of her majesty the queen that it is the will and determination of her majesty s government that this territory shall be and shall continue to he or ever an portion of her majesty s in south africa alas sir g s estimate of the value of a solemn pledge thus made in the name of her majesty whose word has hitherto been held to be sacred differed greatly to that of mr and his government sir s operations against un the proved successful and were the best bit of native warfare that i have yet heard of in south africa one blow was struck and only one but that was crushing of course the secret of his success lay in the fact that he had an abundance of force but it was not by that alone good management being very requisite in an of the sort especially where native have to be dealt with the cost of the expedition not counting other war expenditure amounted to over f all of which is now lost to this country another step in the right direction undertaken by sir was the establishment of an council and also of a council for the establishment of which letters patent were sent from street in november meanwhile the paying no attention to the latter for they guessed that it like other in the would be a mere had assembled for another mass meeting at which they forward a step and declared a government which was to treat with the english they had now learnt that they could do what they liked with perfect provided they did not take the extreme course of the english they had yet to learn that they might even do that at the termination of this meeting a vote of thanks was passed to mr of london and other members of the british parliament it was wise of the leaders to cultivate mr of london as a result of this meeting one of the principal leaders and the secretary were arrested on a charge of treason and the under british rule a preliminary examination but as the secretary of state sir m beach looked rather timidly on the proceeding and the local authorities were doubtful of securing a verdict the was abandoned and necessarily did more harm than good being looked upon as another proof of the of the government shortly afterwards sir g changed his and instead of attempting to offered him a seat on the council with a salary attached this was a much more sensible way of dealing â him and he at once rose to the bait stating his to join the government after a while but that he could not publicly do so at the moment lest he should lose his influence with those who were to be brought round through him it does not however appear that mr ever did actually join the probably because he found public opinion too strong to allow him to do so in december a new light broke upon the for in the previous month mr had been delivering his noted attack on the policy of the government those mid speeches did harm it is said in many parts of the world but i venture to think that they have proved more mischievous in south africa than anywhere else at any rate they have borne fruit sooner it is not to be supposed that mr really cared anything about the or its independence when he was the hideous outrage that had been by the government in it on the contrary as he in the the tion at the time when lord stated thai it was evidently and declined to it when he came into power it is to be supposed that he really approved of it or at the least looked on it as a necessary evil however this may be any stick will do to beat a dog and the was a

have so greatly the cost of if any man has or can buy a tract of or land too poor or broken to be let liim shut out cattle and steadily plant choice trees while cutting out poorer let him cut every tree that stops growing and begins to decay or shed its limbs let him not hesitate to thin as well as trim up let him cut out oak for instance and sow the of white let him when half a dozen or start from a single stump cut away all but two or three and by and by cut again and i am confident that he may thus grow timber twice as rapidly as where it is neglected and grow trees far more valuable than those that come by chance nay if near a city he can make a thousand dollars far more easily though less quickly by growing timber than by growing grain the land i ultimately bought included part of an old orchard which i estimated worth a little more than the that might be made of it but there i was mistaken old apple trees never or with indifferent i i i i â i mt farming fruit and which have been suffered to grow out of proper shape to a height of forty or fifty feet so that flourish in their tops with are simply if you buy or inherit such cut them down the moment you can obtain fruit for your own use om others on the land i first purchased as a young orchard of two acres mainly â small fruit but not inviting to worms it keeps splendidly â in fact hardly becomes till april or may the and pretty constantly so that if i were planting for profit in this region i should give this sort the preference i carefully avoid the common error which i when committed of planting many sorts together indeed i would prefer to have but one sort in an orchard for the convenience of gathering and my young are just beginning to bear the ground was not so deeply as it should be â in fact the ground on which apple trees are to be set should be three feet deep â but it has been well and i hope for good crops in the years close at hand in the little or through which my brook from the wood wherein it has down the hill to dance across a gentle slope to the swamp below is the spring â pure as crystal never failing cold as you could wish it for drink in the day and so thoroughly shaded and sheltered that i am confident it was never warm and never frozen over many springs on my farm are excellent but this is it determined the of my which stands on a little or bench of level ground down the hill some twenty rods north of and forty feet higher than itself i never saw a sweeter spot than was the little of grass which my house has with tall woods all around and a growth of young

my friends at stated seasons and not at home to any one when i address myself to work and especially to the of a yet literary project but these are dreams which opportunity may never be afforded to realize as yet i am a horse in a bark mill and tread his monotonous round never finding time to do to day what can possibly be postponed to the morrow the portion of my has been patiently improved by

young god doomed to rack and ruin in four or five short years and to pass hence without posterity to receive the splendid it was his to j the people of the abyss it seemed to waste such life and yet i was forced to confess that he was right in not marrying on four pound ten in london town just as the scene was happier in making both ends meet in a room shared with two other men than he would have been had he packed a feeble family along with a couple of men into a cheaper room and failed in making both ends meet and day by day i became convinced that not only is it unwise but it is criminal for the people of the abyss to marry they are the stones by the rejected there is no place for them in the social fabric while all the forces of society drive them downward till they perish at the bottom of the abyss they are feeble and if they the life is so cheap that it of itself the work of the world goes on above them and they do not care to take part in it nor are they able moreover the work of the world does not need them there are plenty far than they clinging to the steep slope above and struggling to slide no more in short the london abyss is a vast year by year and after rural england in a flood of vigorous strong life that not only does not renew itself but by the third generation competent authorities that a man and the abyss t the london workman whose parents and were

that last year and yesterday and to day at this very moment of these creatures are dying miserably at the bottom of the social pit called london as to how they die i shall take an instance from this morning s paper self neglect yesterday dr held an at respecting the death of elizabeth aged years of east street who died on wednesday last that she was landlady of the house where deceased lived witness last saw her alive on the previous monday she lived quite alone mr francis officer for the district stated that deceased had occupied the room in question for years when witness was called on the st he found the old woman in a terrible state and the and coachman had to be after the removal dr chase said death was due to blood from bed due to self neglect and filthy surroundings and the jury returned a verdict to that effect the most startling thing about this little incident a woman s death is the complacency with i the people of the abyss which the officials looked upon it and rendered judgment that an old woman of seventy seven years o age should die of self is the most way possible of looking at it it was the old dead woman s fault that she died and having the

the life i left behind me in the east end of london â my first impression of east london was naturally a general one later the details began to appear and here and there in the chaos of misery i found little spots where a fair measure of happiness reigned â sometimes whole rows of houses in little out of the way streets where dwell and where a rude sort of family life in the evenings the men can be seen at the doors pipes in their mouths and children on their knees wives and laughter and fun going on the content of these people is great for relative to the wretchedness that they are well off but at the best it is a dull animal happiness the content of the full belly the dominant note of their lives is they are stupid and heavy without imagination the abyss seems to a atmosphere of which i the

21,1994,suddenly he saw a strange thing like mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath gray s hands then amongst the sticks them selves appeared a live thing twisting and turning of a color like the color of the sun in the sky knew nothing about fire it drew him as the light in the mouth of the cave had drawn him in hia early he crawled the several toward the flame he heard gray chuckle above him and he the sound was not hostile then his nose touched the flame and at the same instant his little tongue went out to it for a moment he was the unknown lurking in the midst of the sticks and moss was savagely clutching him by the nose he scrambled backward bursting out in an astonished explosion of ki s at the sound leaped to the makers of fire the end of her stick and there raged terribly because she could not come to his aid but gray laughed loudly and his and told the happening to all the rest of the camp till everybody was laughing but white sat on his and ki d and ki d a forlorn and pitiable little figure in the midst of the it was the worst hurt he had ever known both nose and tongue by the live thing sun colored that had grown up under gray s hands he cried and cried and every fresh wail was greeted by bursts of laughter on the part of the man animals he tried to soothe his nose with his tongue but the tongue was burnt too and the two hurts coming together produced greater hurt whereupon he cried more hopelessly and helplessly than ever and then shame came to him he knew laughter and the meaning of it it is not given us to know how some animals know laughter and know when they are being laughed at but it was this same way that white knew it and he felt shame that the man animals should be laughing at him he turned and fled away not from the hurt of the fire but from the laughter that sank even deeper and hurt in the spirit of him and he fled to raging at the end of her stick like an animal gone white mad â to the one creature in the world who was not laughing at him twilight drew down and night came on and white lay by his mother s side his nose and tongue still hurt but he was perplexed by a greater trouble he he felt a in him a need for the hush and of the stream and the cave in the cliff life had become too there were so many of the man animals men women and children all making noises and and there were the dogs ever and bursting into and creating the loneliness of the only life he had known was gone here the very air was with life it and continually changing its intensity and abruptly in pitch it on his nerves and senses made him nervous and restless and worried him with a perpetual of happening he watched the man animals coming and going and moving about the camp in fashion resembling the way men look upon the gods they create so looked white upon the man animals before him they were superior creatures of a gods to his dim comprehension they were as much wonder workers as gods are to men they were creatures of mastery possessing all manner of unknown and impossible of the the makers op fire alive and the not alive â making obey that which moved movement to that which did not move and making life sun colored and biting life to grow out of dead moss and wood they were fire makers they were i chapter ii the bondage the days were thronged with experience for white during the time that was tied by the stick he ran about over all the camp inquiring learning he quickly came to know much of the ways of the man animals but familiarity did not breed contempt the more he came to know them the more they their superiority the more they displayed their mysterious powers the greater loomed their god likeness to man has been given the grief often of seeing his gods and his crumbling but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to at man s feet this grief has never come unlike man whose gods are of the unseen and the and mists of fancy the of reality wandering of desired goodness and power of self into the realm of spirit â unlike man the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh solid to the touch occupying iso the bondage earth space and requiring time foi tiie accomplishment of their ends and their existence no effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a god no effort of will can possibly induce in such a god there is no getting away from it there it stands on its two hind legs club in hand immensely passionate and and loving god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that when it is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh and so it was with white the man animals were gods unmistakable and as his mother had rendered her to them at the cry of her name so he was beginning to render his he gave them the trail as a privilege theirs when they walked he got out of their way when they called he came when they threatened he down when they commanded him to go he went away hurriedly for behind any wish of theirs was power to enforce that wish power that hurt power that expressed itself in and clubs ,21
22,2095,the distance the former had and the news of the road which he had brought and when do you expect to reach old v said m i hoped to get there saturday night he replied but again the stranger proves to be his history his character how did you know any thing about my going toward oh i knew i have seen you before me inquired the youth yes your name is i believe yes sir but where did you ever see me oh i have seen you a good many times and am very glad to see you again particularly here s wonder was excited for a few minutes but he did not like to press his inquiries he had no recollection of m though he had often seen him in his boyish days he had now for several years been away from home employed in a large country town fifty or sixty miles from his father s house as a junior clerk in a store he was going home to visit his father and mother he was the same kind hearted dutiful boy that he had ever been the best moral principles had been by his parents and had taken deep root and they controlled his general character and in such a manner as to afford great promise for the future he was in fact growing up his parents pride and joy beneath all this fair exterior however there was in the heart a secret but still a clear and decided from god â using the word however in a very mild sense a strange but powerful feeling of made him his maker s presence the little prayers which his mother had taught him in infancy to be repeated morning and evening he had gradually ceased to use and they were repeated merely mechanically and as a form for a long time before he gave them up altogether he did not deliberately intend to abandon a practice so but the idea of drawing near to god was somehow or other not agreeable and between the of conscience and the force of habit on one side and the constant pressure of m had become confirmed in bis aversion on the other the practice gradually gave way and left him at last without even the empty form of communion with his maker how many young persons of eighteen can say that this story is theirs when removed to his new sphere of duty in the village store his position in respect to intercourse with god remained the same and he gradually learned to justify and defend it before he not only always had an instinctive feeling that he was wrong hut would always have admitted his guilt and danger if the subject had been brought up by a religious friend but the â we mean by this not the wickedness but simply the living without god â the of cities and towns in fact of all cultivated and intellectual is always better defended than that of the solitary farm houses and secluded of the country there are certain phrases and modes of expression current among those who live in sin which while they do not really justify even to the sinner s own conscience at least give him something to say he is not left speechless he becomes accordingly somewhat fortified in his position and yet it is not a real feeling of safety and protection after all he is secretly aware that his works are no but still he takes refuge in them as a man feels safer in his house than in the fields during a thunder storm though he is all the time well aware that the roof above him is no protection however had begun to himself a little with the weapons of such as they are with which men attempt to justify their neglect of the means of salvation they did not really satisfy him but they had an effect to fix and confirm him in and to render him inaccessible to sentiments of religious truth and duty again evening at m s evening after a time m called his boy away from his mill and they all went together into the house the guest was ushered into a room which served the double purpose of kitchen and parlor they found there the wife busy before the great stone fire place preparing supper an infant was sleeping in a rude cradle in the middle of the room the woman was obviously gratified at the appearance of a visitor nor was it simply a feeling of benevolence which caused the gratification even s hospitality was probably heightened by his solitude at any rate the appearance of a guest was an incident highly welcome in this secluded valley they made a long evening of it in social and animated conversation m told endless stories of being lost in the woods by bears blocked up by snow storms and other such forest adventures as much of danger and of dramatic interest as can be furnished by a country in which there is scarcely any thing but the elements to fear enjoyed his evening highly there was something in the farmer s plain manners his frank and cordial address his hearty laugh and in the quiet enjoyment with which his wife seemed to listen to the talk that gave the whole scene a great charm for him he sat upon a large settle by the side of the fire place holding the boy in his lap who listened with breathless attention to all that was said at length the great bible was taken down m took his little son in his lap and sat up to the table before it as he read the boy looked on with the most fixed attention while the father held the child s little plump and finger at the place moving its extremity from word to word along the line to follow the ,22
22,2096,in its form with the size of the cover he found that by folding it once more that is into the form it would fit the cover very well so he cut it open at the folding and then after folding it again he slipped it into the cover and went to find said he how do you think this will do to put your little flowers in up the tain it is made of paper and that is much better than the paper of books to press plants in for it the moisture and so the plants quicker and that makes them preserve their colors better u that will be excellent said taking the book and looking at it with great interest but how did you know about that ben our professor of at the said told us that it is better to have a book made of paper only this book is not could you it i can it in a moment said then it will do nicely said if you can the leaves together so as to make a book of them then we can slip them into the book cover and that will be all we shall want i can carry it in my pocket you see you don t want large specimens the smaller and more delicate they are the better our professor told us that your professor repeated yes replied he us about it l young gentlemen said he the mode of is very different both in the selection of flowers and in the method of preserving them according to the object you have in view whether to procure specimens for purposes of science or and tokens for purposes of sentiment and love repeated these words in a tone and manner of a making a discourse before an audience producing thus a very effect so that both john and laughed outright oh exclaimed ben i don t believe he said any such things added john he verily did replied c young gentlemen said he l when you have advanced a little farther along the and path of life you will sometimes have occasion in your various wanderings to prepare plants and flowers as tokens of remembrance or of other sentiments or as of travel in such cases gentlemen select small and delicate specimens â of graceful forms and pretty colors press them till they are dry between leaves of paper if necessary separate the leaves and stems so as to press and preserve them separately you can your flower afterward examine the specimens from time to time while they are drying and see that the stems lie in natural and graceful curves and that the leaves and are smooth and fully extended then when they are thoroughly dry arrange the parts anew and them delicately upon a small piece of white paper with a suitable inscription beneath and the paper in a tinted envelope of the right size to contain it â and then when you present it to the mary or the or the for whom it is intended she will perceive that you are a ben young gentleman of taste and skill as well as of science finished this of a portion of the professor s lecture with such an air of mock gravity that and john both laughed louder than ever oh said john did the professor really say that yes said and we all clapped him it seems to me you have pretty funny doings at the said we do sometimes said but hark he added i thought i heard wheels coming no they are not coming yet but we must hot waste any more time we must get ready the dog cart will be here very soon good i said john at the same time cutting a to express his joy but what kind of dogs will they be he added turning to will they be dogs there they come said run to the window and see john supposed that a dog cart was a cart made to be drawn by dogs in this idea he was greatly mistaken a dog cart being made to carry dogs and not to be drawn by them it is ben quite a curious vehicle having its origin in the wish of to provide some means of their dogs as well as themselves and their guns when going into the field so that the dogs may be fresh and in good condition for their work when they arrive there it is a very handsomely made vehicle in the form of a cart the seat is double there being places for two persons to sit on the front part facing the horse and two directly behind them with their backs against those of the first two underneath this double seat is a box or recess for the dogs the lid which this box is behind and is made to open down in such a manner that when it is opened it is sustained by a support which holds it in nearly a position where it forms a foot board for the two persons riding behind to rest their feet upon the children were all very much interested in examining the form and construction of the when they went down to the door the coachman took the right hand front seat mrs took the other front seat john and and took the seat behind where they were so much crowded at first that john said he had a great mind to play that he was a or a and crawl into the box below ben after having been shaken together a little while by the of the carriage â for a moves even upon a smooth road with a very and motion â they found themselves quite comfortable and they had a very amusing ride when they reached the end of the they found a guide there ready for them he took the bag containing ,22
22,2097,it was nearly time for them to gather their beans when they came out of the garden robert asked his father to look at the of the gate which he said was coming off there was a narrow piece of board nailed upon the post and the hinges of the gate were nailed to that by some means or other however this the inspection board had got split where the upper was fastened to it and so the was loose robert pointed it out to his father ah yes said he i ain glad you showed me this very soon the would have come off and then the lower would have got broken now we save them the then looked at the board and said it was split and there must be a new one made so he took out some tools from robert s box and took off the hinges very carefully then he set the gate up by the fence on one side then he took off the split board and gave it to can you carry that into the shop was a very small boy but he was very glad to help when he could he took the board which was not very heavy but was about as much as he could well carry and began g it along now robert said tlie general some time this afternoon i want you to saw out a piece of board just the size of that and get it all ready to put on when it is done carry it out to the gate and stand it up there also put a tool box there and an axe so that every thing vâ be ready and then remind me at supper time to go and put it on i can put it on in a moment among the mountains if you get every thing ready â and now the inspection is over so saying the general went away and said â well robert you put your tools away while i go and get the cakes the cakes said what cakes why mother always gives each of us a cake inspection day so that we may not forget to remind father of it followed into the house she supposed that she would go and ask her mother for the cakes and wished that she was going to have one too but did not go after her mother she went directly to a closet as she was the door of the closet she said â mother always puts our cakes here on a particular shelf â three of them all in a row they went into the closet and th re they found the cakes only there were four instead of three why here are four said mother has made a mistake no said one must be for me so it is said ive no doubt i ll go and ask mother the inspection she accordingly went off to ask her mother and presently came back saying that the fourth was for and she accordingly gave her one it was a round cake not very thick but it looked as if it was sweet carried the other two out to give them to robert and went to show hers to her mother she found her taking a walk under the trees which had seen fix m out the bedroom window took hold of her mother s hand with one of hers while she held the cake in the other and so she walked along with her and told her all about the inspection her mother listened with a good deal of interest and when she had done she said that she thought it was an excellent plan to have an in yes ther and so do i and i wish you would have one when we go home i think i will said her mother once a month mother said it must be once a month the general has it once a month yes said her mother i should think that about right i can inspect your treasury yes mother said i ll keep it in excellent order among mountains only you couldn t mend the broken about the house very well continued no said her mother but then our inspection would not be just like a farmer s we should drawers and and and such places i think it will be an excellent plan and a cake for me and royal at the end said is that an essential part of the plan asked her mother essential repeated what is why necessary that is is it an indispensable part of the plan that there should be cakes distributed why yes said that is to make us remind you of it you see you would forget when inspection day was coming unless we reminded you and so we must have a cake on reflection s mother concluded that this was as represented a very important part of the plan and she pretty nearly concluded that when she returned home she would adopt the inspection system for her part of the house cakes and all chapter iv a walk that evening after the and her mother went out to take a walk upon a high hill back of the general s house to see the prospect comfort told them that they could get to the top of it without through the grass at all why don t you want to go through the grass mother said because there may be some dew upon it which might wet our feet said her mother but are you sure comfort said she that we can get up to the top without getting the yes said comfort i m sure and i ll go if you wish and show you the way s mother liked this plan very much and so they set off together about half an hour before sunset they followed a cart road down ,22
22,2098,my boy she continued never mind the umbrella now put it down and come under my cloak we will keep close together i suppose there is nothing that we can do sir she continued speaking to m but m had gone is there any thing we can do she repeated to the whom she just then saw coming toward the place where she was sitting no replied the i don t know of any thing we can do we must take our chance of running on to the shore below are there good places to land along the bank m the bewildered m takes the command not very good said the shaking his head we shall get into the i suppose before we bring up where the banks are steep and rocky but i hope we shall get ashore safe yet it was very dark and the winds and waves swept the boat down the river with great rapidity it was so thick that they could scarcely see the water about them and so far as they could see there was nothing to prevent their being brought up without a moment s warning upon a sharp point of rocks or upon a hidden ledge in the middle of the the was entirely bewildered by the circumstances in which he was placed he had oars and on board and once on a former occasion when the wire had given way in daylight he had easily succeeded in working the boat out of the current â where the water was deep with the oars before she drifted down to the and then when once in shallow water it was easy to set the boat in any direction but now he was confounded and bewildered he could not tell exactly whereabouts they were and of course did not know which way to attempt to steer m seeing his and helplessness pretty soon assumed the command the character of his mind and the experience which he had acquired in his various adventures had made him a man of great resources in an emergency and had given him especially a

each side and the nature of the curves in the course of the stream below and in fact made a sort of mental of the waters which they were so much against their will about to while making these inquiries he was not idle he the boat the boat down the stream wind and rain got two long setting poles to that end of the boat which was down the stream and stationed the at one side and the at the other to sound every minute or two by plunging the pole down into the water in order to receive warning by that means when they should approach the land he also a rope and made it ready to throw ashore as soon as they should touch the land and he stationed squire stock who expressed at once a desire to do any thing in his power under m s direction with a lantern him to keep a sharp look out

23,2200,shall perish will think of the matter said arthur and in the morning i will give you my answer as he withdrew to his own chamber came and stood before him o king said the let me advise you take only thirty of your most trusted knights and ride to the help of but tell him not your name and let no one in know who you are or whence you have come i will ride with you and direct you and you shall have victory and a great reward so on the morrow the king chose thirty of his most men to go with him upon this new adventure all were well mounted with their before them and their in their hands the trumpet sounded the word of command was given and the band rode out of the gates and over the hills towards far taller by half a head than any of his comrades stories of the king young arthur took the lead but his was of the sort and neither on nor shield did he bear any sign of his high rank people watching the heroes as they passed and judging only by the richness of their arms would have chosen sir or sir of the or young sir as their leader and king but when arthur spoke or when he rode first and most into the face of danger he seemed to tower so far above all the others that those seeing him were sure to say this is the man so through the forest and the wild marsh lands the heroes with songs upon their lips and joy in their hearts the messengers of king led them by the shortest to the war wasted fields of their master the gates of were opened to them and they entered silently with old at their head king showed but little joy at their coming i had hoped said he to his that the young prince at would send an army to me but i see here only thirty men and who is this old man who rides with them he looks more like a scholar than a warrior nevertheless they are welcome all friends are welcome when one has so many enemies the very next day king the traitor came the relief of he had with him a host of reckless men false knights and robber chiefs and the of the land and they just outside of the city gates they shouted defiance to they hurled their over the wall they shot their arrows far into the city they the king to lead out his fighting men and meet them on the field of battle but was helpless his best warriors had been slain his had forsaken him he had no army to lead to battle he sat in his castle and his ill fortune all now is lost he said then with king arthur and his heroes him to open the gates and let them go out and give battle to king and his rebel host but only moaned the more bitterly and said no it is better that you remain within the walls to us for if you go out you will all perish in the fight thereupon and the heroes mounted their and stood at the fast barred gates waiting they heard the shouting of king and his men outside they cried have patience but a little while we will meet you in battle then the mighty lifted his hands and muttered a strange spell with uncouth words which j stories of the ar none could understand he rode forward and lifted the huge gates of upon his shoulders while king arthur and his knights rode bravely through he muttered still another spell and the gates fell back to their places and unseen hands bolted and barred them fast as before now on to the great victory he shouted never shall we return cried arthur until we have subdued the foes of britain the heroes gave spur to their and with poised rushed into the midst of the rebel host ah then there was fighting such as had never seen before ah then did arthur prove himself worthy of the crown but there is no need that we follow him and his knights as they smote the robber chiefs and put them utterly to there is no need to tell more concerning the great victory which was won that day â thirty men fighting against thirty thousand in the fields of soon the story was carried to every castle and every hut between and distant and knights and fighting men came to join themselves to king arthur s band these he led on to other and more famous he smote the heathen from over the sea and drove them hither and thither in wild dismay the relief of twelve times they rallied and offered battle and twelve times they were and twelve times did king arthur lead his heroes into the fight and twelve times did his loud voice stay pursuit and bid the spare their foes then on a fair morning in summer the heroes rode back to right did their tattered float in the breeze and right merrily did their horses hoofs keep time with the sounding trumpet and the rattling at the gates king waited to welcome them to the city which their had saved and the on the walls cried hail to the conquering heroes hail to the nameless knights who have delivered us from the then as the heroes entered a troop of children went before them scattering flowers while on either side of the way of young men and maidens sang songs of joy and victory they rode onward through narrow streets where wondering people looked out to see them pass they rode onward and while many eyes were turned towards the tall knight with yellow hair and shield none guessed that he was the king of the ,23

thereupon was at once the assertion that no boy in the fifth form can blush for into dick s olive ce came a very decided tinge of color i did buy her a but it was not with that money replied he with unwonted it was a very foolish reply and one which would have only occurred to a very young indeed had he been really the gentleman in trouble of whom we have spoken he would have previously been put upon his by the law itself and solemnly warned not to commit himself by any such impulsive statement poor dick thought he had found a flaw in the instead of laying himself open to a new and equally serious charge then where did you get the first money did your father you with any other sums than the head master s fee and which you it was my own money i raised it at the s on my watch and dick his

action he rose with the lark instead as before of retiring to rest about that period and went to bed at a wholesome hour he passed his days on horseback or on foot in his fields he bought at a high price and sold at a low one and gave promise of becoming a farmer with results only slightly more disastrous than usual he had plenty of method which indeed he flattered himself was his strong point but it was not of the right sort experience was wanting to him and he purchased it â like everything else he dearly but to the loving eyes that were looking further for him than into his yearly balance sheet the experiment was answering admirably when a misfortune occurred that crushed the hope herself was taken ill the fact of playing so long to a very audience had tried her nerves in many ways even richard s love which to do him justice never was insufficient to support her under such adverse circumstances and indeed was in itself a source of weakness since but for ,25

after another declined my addresses under various but all having reference to my too constant companion a mother in law living in the house would be nothing to him observed one indignantly why we should never know what it was to be alone argued another and is all very well remarked a third but and and john are quite out of the question if you and i were one remonstrated a fourth who had no little talent for and you and john are one then john and i would be one which would be very disagreeable john s habits too were irregular and it was urged with great reason and some force that he might refuse to come home till morning or even get locked up in the station house in which case i might just as well so far as my wife was concerned have been as dissipated as himself one thing therefore appeared absolutely necessary to my entering into the matrimonial state â namely that john should give up his â xi one of two likewise in order to bring this about i set my affections upon one of two sisters but fortunately not united by any so that in case john could be induced to admire the other our double courtship could be carried on with some convenience for once my alter acted with my wishes and whenever jones came to say a few words to me in her mother s back he was always ready to hold sweet converse with her sister the dear girls got at last to think little or nothing of our little peculiarity although their friends could never quite get over it but continued to ask us to dine on days or one of us to dinner and the other generally john to come in the evening â invitations which of course had to be declined perhaps this double marriage might really have come and have conferred a laurel upon the church of st in whose parish the resided but the of john prevented it i have said that he and i were alike but this was by no means the case with the miss the one â the one â being considerably more attractive than the other upon a certain occasion when i happened to be engaged in de my entered the room and coming straight towards me with affectionate enthusiasm was received with open arms by john perceiving this sign of welcome upon his part she never reflected that he was upon the wrong side of us to be me but gave him an affectionate embrace while i went on with my studies so that i might not interrupt the tender passages between ray alter and a one of two beloved object not until came in â some minutes afterwards â was this base discovered by either or myself you may easily imagine our indignation while to crown all actually accused her sister of being a not altogether unwilling victim of the deception such a very remarkable lovers quarrel has rarely i suppose taken place before and it was rendered still more exceptional by not being the renewal of love declined to have anything more to do with john and although with much reluctance declared that she could not subject herself to the possibility of such a mistake again this misfortune which appeared at the time to be so terrible turned out in the end the cause of my i was so enraged with john that i insisted upon our at once consulting the best on the subject of a dissolution of a divorce a as it might truly be called we had done this upon one occasion before but having been informed that the experiment would be had not ventured to undergo it now however death itself seemed almost as welcome as this existence while on the other hand the prospect of a single life seemed as as ever did married one to sighing lover no before sir or his successor was ever more anxious for a decree o dissolution than i john would have been content enough to let matters stand as they were and was to run any risk of losing his precious life but i was not only firm but furious and gave him to understand that if science would not aid us i would part company from him at all who would one of two be free themselves must strike the blow quoted i with meaning and at the same time arranged my in readiness for the worst by this argument i brought the â if i may so him â to reason we pleaded our common cause before the of our fate the of the of destiny they were unwilling to hazard the operation and perhaps rather to mar such an admirable natures as ourselves in vain i enlarged upon our wrongs and dwelt upon our i am deprived gentlemen urged i by this mere strip of flesh of the dearest rights of i can represent no in parliament except where there are two seats and john happens to be elected to fill the other one â a thing most improbable nor can i be a for john is a

26,2516,is black at heart hollow and black anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added â my expressions you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable persuasion s others and we were almost always principally in town in very good style hen the inferior in circumstances he was then poor one he had chambers in the temple and it as much as he could do to support appearance gentleman he had always a home with us when â er he chose it he was always welcome he was like brother my poor charles who had the finest most spirit in the world would have divided his last ing with him i know that his purse was open to i know tliat he often assisted this must have been about that very period of mr s life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him there was a something in then with regard y and sister and afterwards in the of his marriage which i never could re ie with present times it seemed to announce a son of man i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him of for ever know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would lie expect j and as to his marriage i knew all about at the i was to all the and was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you wish to put nay said anne i liave no particular persuasion to make about her i have rs understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr draw back â mr replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an marriage and i know it was his belief whether or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their and invitations were a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole he had no with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss and i thought very affectionately of the other perhaps cried anne by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne and for your being a very different creature from â she checked herself just in time this accounts for something which mr said last night cried anne this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken i r but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr married completely for money the circumstance probably which first opened your eyes to his character mrs smith hesitated a little here â â oh those things are too common when one lives â the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time sickness and sorrow have given me other notions hut at that period i must own i saw nothing in what mr was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty but was not she a very low woman yes which objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a line woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune ,26
26,2517,me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases pin cushions and card which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood she has a large acquaintance of course among persuasion those who can afford to buy and she of my she always takes the right time for applying everybody s heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of and nurse thoroughly understands when to speak she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion makes her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to call it gossip if you will but when nurse has half an hour s leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know one s species better one likes to hear what is going on to be au as to the modes of being trifling and silly to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat anne far from wishing to at the pleasure replied i con believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally imder every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the and all the sacrifices that us most a sick chamber may often the worth of volumes yes said mrs smith more sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately speaking low and there are so many who forget to think till it is almost too late anne saw the misery of such feelings the had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off and soon added in a different tone â i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs is in at present will much either to interest or me she is only nursing mrs of a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high things i have in hand now anne had called several times on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in place at last it became necessary to speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning from place with a sudden invitation from lady for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in buildings she was not sorry for the excuse they were only asked she was sure because lady being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account with great alacrity â she was engaged to spend the evening with an old they were not much interested in anything relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked to make it understood who this old was and elizabeth was and sir walter severe buildings said he and who is miss anne to be visiting in buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of the five thousand mr whose names are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction that she is old persuasion and sickly upon my word miss anne you have the most extraordinary taste everything that other people low company paltry rooms fool air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged but what does lady think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary she it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter sir henry s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome and no doubt is well known to convey a miss a ,26
26,2518,xiii unaccountable however as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family it was certain that edward was free and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre determined by all â for after the blessings of one engagement contracted without his mother s consent as he had already done for more than four years nothing less could be j and sensibility expected of him in the failure than the immediate of another his errand at in fact was a simple one it was only to ask to marry him and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did so much in need of encouragement and fresh air how soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution however how soon an opportunity of it occurred in what manner he expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly told this only need be said â that when they all sat down to table at four o clock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his lady engaged her mother s consent and was not only in the profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one of the happiest of men his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful he had more than the triumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise his spirits he was released without any reproach to himself from an which had long formed his misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love and elevated at once to that security with another which he must have thought of almost with despair as soon as he had i learned to consider it with desire he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to happiness and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine flowing grateful as his friends had never witnessed in him before his heart was now open to all its weaknesses all its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment to treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty four it was a foolish idle inclination on my side said he the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left with what i thought at the time a most preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage ray time x and me at a distance from her for a few months i should soon have the â attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such a case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to choose any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first afterwards i had not even the employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be veiy often at where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen appeared every thing that was amiable and obliging she was pretty at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could no and see no defects considering every thing therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an piece of folly the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the was such â so great â as promised them all the of a sleepless night mrs too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love edward nor praise enough how to be enough thankful for his release without his delicacy nor how at once to give them leisure for conversation together and yet enjoy as she wished the sight and society of both could speak happiness only by tears would occur â regrets would arise and her joy though sincere as her love for her sister was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language but â how are her feelings to be described from the moment of learning that was married to another that edward was free to the moment of his the â sense and sensibility hopes which had so instantly followed she was thing by turns but tranquil but when the second moment had passed when she found every doubt every removed compared her situation with what so lately it had been â saw him released from his former engagement â saw him instantly by the release to address herself and declare an affection as tender as constant as she had ever supposed it to be â she was oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily with any change for the better it required several hours to give to her spirits or any degree of tranquillity to her heart edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week for whatever other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of s company ,26
26,2519,of the case admitted in speaking of the he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness especially of mrs s exertions as persuasion a nurse she really left nothing for mary to do he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night mary had been hysterical again this morning when he came away she was going to walk out with captain which he hoped would do her good he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was that mrs left nothing for anybody to do charles was to return to the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent it would be going only to trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon a chaise was sent for from and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the lingering and long master harry sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the and she could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss vague wishes of getting thither had occurred before to mrs and but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable so soon they were indebted the next day to charles for all the minute knowledge of which it was so essential to obtain every twenty four hours he made it his business to go to and his account was still encouraging the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger every report agreed in captain s appearing fixed in anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded what should they do without her they were wretched for one an persuasion other and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was and persuade them all to go to at once she had difficulty it was soon determined that they would go go to morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings as it suited and there remain till dear could be moved they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with they might at least relieve mrs from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning at better than in assisting their preparations and sending them off at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses of all that had given its cheerful character a few days had made a change indeed if recovered it would all be well again more than former happiness would be restored there could not be a doubt to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love all that was most unlike anne an hour s complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark november day a small thick rain almost out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the sound of lady s carriage exceedingly welcome persuasion and though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble of the village â a heart scenes had passed in which made it precious it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe but now softened and of some instances of feeling some of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been anne had never entered since her lady s house in september it had not been necessary and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to and escape from her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge and to the eyes of its mistress there was some anxiety mixed with lady s joy in meeting her she knew who had been but happily either anne was improved in and looks or lady fancied her so and anne in her compliments on the occasion had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving and which she had felt and been compelled to among the were now become but of

or low ever filling the landscape with spiritual animation and the of its sources in every movement and tone pursuing my lonely way down the valley i turned again and again to gaze on the glorious picture throwing up my arms to it as in a frame after long ages of growth in the darkness beneath the through sunshine and storms it seemed now to be ready and waiting for the elected artist like yellow wheat for the and i could not help wishing that i might carry colors and with me on my travels and learn to paint in the mean time i had to be content with photographs on my mind and sketches in my note books at length after i had rounded a that puts out from the west wall of the valley every peak vanished from sight and i pushed rapidly along the frozen meadows over the divide between the waters of the and and down through the forests that clothe the slopes of cloud s arriving in in due time â which a view of the high with me is any time and strange to say among the first people i met here were two artists who with letters of introduction were awaiting my return they inquired whether in the course of my in the adjacent mountains i had ever come upon a landscape suitable for a large painting whereupon i began a description of the one that had so lately excited my admiration then as i went on further and further into details their faces began to glow and i offered to guide them to it while they declared that they would gladly follow far or near i could e the time to lead them since storms might come breaking down through the fine weather at any time the colors in snow and cutting off the artists retreat i advised getting ready at once i led them out of the valley by the and falls thence over the main dividing ridge to the big meadows by the old trail and thence along the upper river to its head this was my companions first excursion into the high and as i was almost always alone in my the way that the fresh beauty was reflected in their faces made for me a novel and interesting study they naturally were affected most of all by the colors â the intense of the sky the of the granite the red and of dry meadows and the purple and crimson of the flaming yellow of groves the silvery flashing of the streams and the bright green and blue of the lakes but the general the mountains of sion of the scenery â rocky and savage â seemed sadly and as they the forest from ridge to ridge eagerly the as they were unfolded they said all this is huge and sublime but we see nothing as yet at all available for effective pictures art is long and art is limited you know and here are middle gi all alike bare rock waves woods groves of meadow and of glittering water never mind i replied only bide a and i will show you something you will like at length toward the end of the second day the crown began to come into view and when we had fairly rounded the projecting before mentioned the whole picture stood revealed in the flush of the their enthusiasm was excited beyond bounds and the more impulsive of the two a young dashed ahead shouting and and tossing his arms in the air like a madman here at last was a typical landscape after awhile on the view i proceeded to make camp in a sheltered grove a little way back from the meadow where pine boughs could be obtained for beds and where there was plenty of for fires while the artists ran here and there along the river and up the sides of the choosing for sketches after dark when our tea was made and a rousing fire had been built we began to make our plans they decided to remain several days at the least while i con a view of the high to make an excursion in the mean time to the untouched summit of bitter it was now about the middle of october the of snow flowers the first winter clouds had already and the peaks were strewn with fresh without however affecting the climbing to any dangerous extent and as the weather was still profoundly calm and the distance to the foot of the mountain only a little more than a day i felt that i was running no gi eat risk of being storm bound mount is king of the mountains of the middle portion of the high as of the north and of the south sections moreover as far as i know it had never been climbed i had the adjacent wilderness summer after summer but my studies thus far had never drawn me to the top of it its height above sea level is about feet and it is round by inclined and of tremendous depth and which render it almost inaccessible but difficulties of this kind only the next morning the artists went heartily to their work and i to mine former experiences had given good reason to know that passionate storms invisible as yet might be brooding in the calm therefore before bidding farewell i warned the artists not to be alarmed should i fail to appear before a week or ten days and advised them in case a snow storm should set in to keep up big fires and shelter themselves as best they could and the mountains op on no account to become frightened and attempt to ,28

warmed my heart and given it a good meal and now my heart feels good the most striking characteristic of these people is their serene dignity in circumstances that to us would be novel and embarrassing even the little children behave with natural dignity come to the white men when called and restrain their wonder at the strange prayers hymn singing etc this evening an old woman fell asleep in the meeting and began to and though both old and young were shaken with suppressed mirth they evidently took great pains to conceal it it seems wonderful to me that these savages can make one feel at home in their families in good breeding intelligence and skill in whatever they try to do with tools they seem to me to rank above most of our white i have never yet seen a child even to the extent of an angry word scolding so common a curse in civilization is not known here at all on the contrary the young are fondly indulged without being spoiled crying is very rarely heard in the house of this chief a pet s was a great favorite with old and young it was therefore delightfully confiding and playful and human cats were and the confidence with a voyage to northward which these cautious thoughtful animals met strangers showed that they were kindly treated there were some ten or a dozen houses all told in the village the count made by the chief for mr young showed some seven hundred and twenty five persons in the tribe chapter x the discovery of bay from here on october we set sail for guide s ice mountains the handle of our heaviest axe was cracked and as declared that there was no to be had in the big bay we would have to load the with a store for cooking at an island out in the strait a few miles from the village we were therefore anxious to buy or trade for a good sound axe in exchange for our broken one good are rare in rocky soon or late an unlucky stroke on a stone concealed in moss spoils the edge finally one in almost perfect condition was offered by a young for our broken handled one and a half dollar to boot but when the broken axe and money were given he promptly demanded an additional twenty five cents worth of tobacco the tobacco was given him then he required a half dollar s worth more of tobacco which was also given but when he still demanded something more s patience gave way and we sailed in the same condition as to as when we arrived this was the only contemptible commercial affair we encountered among these indians we reached the wooded island about one o clock made coffee took on a store of wood and set sail direct for the icy country finding it very hard indeed the discovery of bay to believe the part of s description of the icy bay so heavily and uniformly are all the shores wherever we had been in this view we were joined by john and none of them on all their travels having ever seen a country we held a course until long after dark when we reached a small that sets in near the mouth of bay on the west side here we made a cold camp on a desolate snow covered beach in stormy and darkness at daybreak i looked eagerly in every direction to learn what kind of place we were in but gloomy rain clouds covered the mountains and i could see nothing that would give me a clue while s hitherto a faithful guide here failed us altogether nevertheless we made haste to be off and fortunately for just as we were leaving the shore a faint smoke was seen across the toward which who now seemed lost gladly our sudden appearance so early that gray morning had evidently alarmed our neighbors for as soon as we were within distance an indian with his face blackened fired a shot over our heads and in a blunt voice roared who are you our shouted friends and the fort missionary then men women and children out of the hut and awaited our approach on the beach one of the hunters having brought his gun with him sternly him asking with superb i travels in indignation whether he was not ashamed to meet a missionary with a gun in his hands friendly relations however were speedily established and as a cold rain was falling they invited us to enter their hut it seemed very small and was full of boxes and bundles nevertheless twenty one persons managed to find shelter in it about a smoky fire our hosts proved to be seal hunters laying in their winter stores of meat and skins the packed hut was well but its heavy smells were not the same to our noses as those we were accustomed to in the of the woods the circle of black eyes peering at us through a fog of and smoke made a novel picture we were glad however to get within reach of information and of course asked many questions concerning the ice mountains and the strange bay to most of which our inquisitive friends replied with as to our object in coming to such a place especially so late in the year they had heard of mr young and his work at fort but could not understand what a missionary could be doing in such a place as this was he going to preach to the and they asked or to the ice mountains and could they take his ,28

chiefs were talking together mr young anxious to know what impression he had made on the tribe with reference to mission work requested john to listen and tell him what was being said they are talking about mr s speech he reported they say he knows how to talk and beats the preacher far also with a smile said mr young hi your friend leads you far in speaking later when the sending of a missionary and teacher was being considered the chief said they wanted me and as an promised that if i would come to them they would always do as i directed follow my give me as many wives as i liked build a church and school and pick all the stones out of the paths and make them smooth for my feet they were about to set out on an expedition to the to collect blankets as or blood money for the death of a woman from drinking furnished by one of the tribe in case of their refusal to pay there would be fighting and one of the chiefs begged that we would pray them good luck so that no one would be killed this he asked as a favor after begging that we would grant permission to go on this expedition promising that they would avoid if possible he spoke in a very natural and easy tone and manner always serene and so much of a polished that travels in all polish was hidden the younger chief stood while speaking the elder sat on the floor none of the congregation had a word to say though they gave and the house was packed at every meeting two a day some climbed on the roof to listen around the smoke opening i tried in vain to avoid but as usual i had to say something at every meeting i made five speeches here all of which seemed to be gladly heard particularly what i said on the different kinds of white men and their motives and their own kindness and good manners in making strangers feel at home in their houses the chief had a slave a young and good looking girl who waited on him cooked his food lighted his pipe for him etc her seemed by no means in the morning just before we left on the return trip john overheard him telling her that after the teacher came from he was going to dress her well and send her to school and use her in every way as if she were his own daughter slaves are still owned by the richest of the formerly many of them were sacrificed on great occasions such as the opening of a new house or the of a pole ordered john to take a pair of white blankets out of his trunk and wrap them about the chiefs shoulders as he sat by the fire this gift was presented without ceremony or saying a single word the chief scarcely noticed the blankets only taking a corner in his hand as if the quality of the wool had been an i l the country of the enemy and of the but now having joined the church he wished to forget the past and bury all the hard and be universally friendly and peaceful it was evident however that he the proud and warlike and doubted the acceptance of his friendly advances and as we approached their village became more and more thoughtful my wife said that my old enemies would be sure to kill me well never mind i am an old man and may as well die as not he was troubled with and while he suffered he put his hand over his heart and said i hope the will shoot me here before venturing up the river to the principal village some ten miles up the river we sent and one of the young as messengers to announce our arrival and inquire whether we would be welcome to visit them informing the chief that both and were mr young s friends and mine that we were all one meat and any harm done them would also be done to us while our messengers were

country of which the enemy might be said to have at this moment complete possession â for horse shoe himself was almost the only in the field against them â and more than that he was but a few miles distant from a camp whose had chased him almost to his present place of refuge it was scarcely probable therefore that he could hope to retain his long under his control or prevent the enemy from receiving intelligence of the capture he was however notwithstanding these as usual cheerful confident and self possessed he had no wish or motive to detain the private soldiers as prisoners of war and would at once have dismissed them if he could have assured himself that they would not make the earliest use of their liberty to convey information of their to the first corps of they should meet

accompanied by a hearty greeting and with an expression of wonder that he should have ventured in hostile guise through a country so beset as this was by the forces of the enemy but when he heard the narrative of the of the morning and saw the of its success in the weapons piled against the wall and more especially when he received from the lips of his wife a account of the part which had been performed in this adventure by his sen his delight seemed almost to be absorbed by his astonishment and incredulity the proofs however were all around him horse shoe and after assuring himself by an

which that experience had taught him were so greatly to be dreaded these frequent passages in his letters as well as the general scope and aim of his literary may be said to present him somewhat in the character of the friend and of youth a title which i am happy to find has been more than once recognized by the young men of the united states in the formation of societies bearing his name and

30,2939,week he ran over during the latter part of the day in order to satisfy himself that she was not losing ground once or twice i went with him but the princess so me for putting an unnecessary strain upon myself that at last i gave up these and remained quietly behind by myself at first i had felt a httle lonely for this was the first time since my marriage to louis that i had been left anywhere by myself but as the occasions went by and i became more accustomed to my surroundings i began to regard louis s frequent as being altogether a matter of course already his cure had come to an end and we had agreed that on leaving the neighborhood we would go to the which the doctors said would be good and even necessary both for the princess and for louis then one morning there arrived an exceedingly letter from the princess s head maid she wrote a to louis saying that madame had had an of the previous evening that is to say immediately before her letter was written that they had called in the doctor who was attending her and he advised that she should communicate with her son immediately madame la wrote recovered very quickly from the attack much more quickly than from any previous attack in which i have seen her but she still looks very drawn and very pallid and i should feel more comfortable if your will come and see her at the earliest possible moment madame la forbade me to communicate the â to your and i humbly beg of you to me from blame should she be angry on finding that i have written to you i had orders to do so from the doctor but had he not so instructed me i should have ventured to take the matter into my own hands as i feel it is not right that your should be left ignorant of the condition of your mother there is nothing for it but my going over at once said louis on receiving this letter oh yes you must go but if i were you i should go as if you knew nothing i will go with you i think i fancy you had better not he said looking at me doubtfully my mother will realize in a moment that has written us a letter if you go without any explanation she was so annoyed the last time that you went because she thought it was unnecessary fatigue and as we are really on the eve of her she would naturally look for an explanation as to why you troubled to come over to day i think you had better let me go alone if i find her not so well i will remain the night but of course i will you if i do that you would not mind my remaining away a night would you oh no i will manage to exist i said with a laugh the strange story of my life i think you are right you know louis there is no need to make her nervous for nothing she is not at all nervous about herself but it may her if she thinks that is so of course i would much prefer to go with you but i think perhaps under the circumstances that it would be wisest if i remained here so we settled it and immediately after luncheon louis took leave of me and started for by this time i had got quite accustomed to his leaving me for short and i set about myself quite happily and i had to take an english friend a lady for a drive among the picturesque pine woods she was in quest of some curious little â mere toys which she had promised to take back to england with her for the benefit of some small i don t know said she as we started exactly where they are to be bought but my sister s children had a few of them taken to them last year by a friend who was staying here and they were most eager that i should get them some more as their doll s house was not sufficiently with them we can easily find out i told her the people in the villages we are passing through will be able to tell us i am sure we shall find no difficulty in meeting with them we made several inquiries as we drove along but either the people were very stupid or they did not understand exactly what we wanted at last however when we were both in despair we inquired at a little inn in a small stone built village apparently the most unlikely spot in the world to find anything of such a nature the good woman of the inn told us that if we would condescend to enter she would send for a neighbor who had many of these little and pots for sale if the a ladies would like refreshment i can offer it said the good woman we asked her what she could give us she told us we could have milk coffee or beer and also excellent sweet cakes let us have some coffee and cakes while she the woman with the little pots said lady in english to me i was perfectly willing and we alighted from the carriage telling our coachman and his fellow servant to refresh themselves while we were waiting the busy house wife was as good as her word she brought us very soon a delightfully homely consisting of coffee cream delicious sweet cakes and honey and while we were of it the friend for whom she had sent arrived with a large basket of tiny and of glazed of every conceivable shape and color my english friend was enchanted with them did you ever see such she cried why ,30

silence the near had fallen silent but from across the valley and by distance still came the song of the answering bird to those fine and delicate notes were full of promise they bore testimony to the soul which dwells forever behind the outward aspect and sense whether she fainted in good truth or whether she passed for a while into that state of consciousness wherein the of habit cease to blind and something of the eternal essence and of things is revealed â perception for once the limits of ordinary apprehension and ordinary of time and place â she could not tell nor did she greatly care for a great peace descended upon her accompanied by a gentle yet penetrating she stood very still her feet set on the warm gravel the night air her about as with a fragrant garment the ghostly sweetness of that far away bird song in her ears while the conviction of the near presence of the man who had so loved her and whom she had so loved deepened within her and therefore it was without alarm without any shock of amazement that gradually she found her aware a slip cup and lip ness of that presence change from something felt to something actually seen he came towards her â that first

fulness of content raising her hands throwing back her head knowing that he would come behind her and take her hands in his and kiss her so bending down over her shoulder and when he came she did not need to speak but only to gaze into the face familiar yet touched â as it seemed to her â with a mysterious and awful beauty beholding which she divined the answer to many questions for she p as one

so that the joy of bride and new wed wife the strange sweet of dawning were with her now not as memories merely but as actual ever present facts â the and therefore permanent revelation of her individual experience she perceived this continued and must continue since it was the fine flower of her nature the of her personal the of the eternal purpose concerning her of ty god the fiction of old age was so was the bitterness of the mournful fiction of being passed sir richard by and to the second place her place was her own her standing ground in the universal order a absolute and she

32,3043,morrow i think you said she observed at last over her shoulder philip was not prepared for the question it forced him to come to a sudden decision no he answered slowly i think i shall remain here for a few days longer â that is of course if you will permit me to do so there was a perceptible interval of silence before mrs pierce s answer came it will be delightful she said at last shall we come into the other room miss and the others will be there it seems to me rather oppressive here thank you i think i won t stay now he responded i rather want a walk i ll come back with my friend to dinner as the two friends were going down to the hotel that night mr suddenly stopped short in the wavering yellow light of one of the few gas lamps in the quaint painted main street of and looked full at his companion i don t half like leaving you behind somehow he said it s not merely the breaking up of our plans though of course i m sorry for that but i take for granted your reasons for staying are good enough and so i accept them without any fuss the good little gentleman moved on again with his quick walk i don t know what it is but hang it all i feel nervous about you philip laughed in a very cheery away you have a wonderful imagination he said why what on earth do you take it is going to happen to me i don t mind the observed the other man apparently rather i d trust her i think at bottom she s a good woman â of course and all that sort of thing but i ll back her to be sound enough here â mr himself heavily in the region of the heart â sound enough here you know he repeated but that little girl â upon my word somehow i fight uncommonly shy of that pretty little girl j test of friendship the colonel looked down he kicked the loose gravel on the walk of the hotel garden â which they were just then crossing â with his foot and laughed again but this time with slight annoyance a thousand to one he said you ll never set eyes on miss pierce again so really i don t think that very much matters chapter v suggests a remedy having once committed himself to of action it was colonel s habit to stand by it even when it failed on more mature consideration to commend itself very highly to his judgment inspired partly by his loyalty to pierce s memory partly by a quick pity for the two women whose position seemed to him such a critical and painful one philip had decided the evening before to stay on at he was going to stick to his post he was going somehow to see them through and yet when in the cheerless light of a very wet morning he bade farewell to kind little mr and saw the latter gentleman pack himself and his baggage into the rattling which was to convey him into philip became conscious that perhaps he had undertaken a very foolish piece of business it was all very well to talk of lines of action but the unfortunate thing was that he hadn t any line at all he could not see his way in the least he turned back into the large brightly painted hotel which looked particularly frivolous and on this gloomy morning in anything but a sweet temper he said to himself that the whole thing was a nuisance and that he had got himself into an awkward fix â and it must be owned he said it with a will the colonel s temper was not improved when on forth some few hours later in a and heavy boots in defiance of the streaming rain he met mr just turning in at the gates of the hotel garden was holding up a large umbrella picking his way carefully along the pavement and looking mildly disgusted yet resigned he had on a very light overcoat and wore the inevitable white in his button hole a trifle brown at the edge of the fi om the wet he nodded to colonel i suppose you rather like this sort of weather it seems en s home like he observed with a sweet of expression which was by no means to a man in an irritable frame of mind two minutes before philip had felt no special objection to the rain the dull sky was really rather a relief after all that gaudy sunlight but for some reason as spoke his opinion went round to another quarter with all the of a on a day it s the most morning i ever saw he replied with considerable the whole place looks miserable it seems to me this country can only look decent in a blaze of sunshine mr smiled faintly yes i understand just what you mean he took a leisurely survey of the large hotel built round three sides of a square and coloured pink with splendid of stone and painted in pale yellow and the shadows they were fondly supposed to cast painted in pale green then he turned and gazed down the many coloured street behind him i understand perfectly what you mean he repeated it looks very like the inside of a theatre by daylight you english people dislike that it strikes you as artificial as for us we others prefer our theatre daylight or to anything else in the world it all appears to me very cheap and said colonel i can t think much of the beauty of a country when it can be spoilt by a few hours rain he glanced at the other man s clothes as he spoke mr ,32

between the acts he answered the red deepening in his clean fresh coloured face not any of that lodge lot oh dear no not all he replied his eyes full of gratitude he blessed the of the wife but speedily embarrassment he found this subject singularly difficult to deal with not at all of their class i confess it did surprise me for though i have always taken it for granted belonged to a higher circle by birth than that in which we have known him i had no idea he had such aristocratic acquaintances his looks and manner in public last night made him seem fitted for any company still i was surprised did he not introduce you no i cannot say he had a convenient opportunity and the lady may not have wished it i could fancy she might hold herself a little above us but between ourselves i believe that was what so upset i am of opinion mr is just as well without mrs declared i suppose she cannot help it but her temper is sadly uncertain i begin to fear she would be very in marriage but was the lady young the good man blushed furiously yes imder thirty i should suppose and very striking to look at had called my attention to her already she thought her over dressed i am no judge of that but i could see she was very beautiful â the far horizon c oh dear this in high protest for the speaker belonged to that section of the british public in which is even yet deeply with the dreary consequence that beauty whether of person or in art is suspect to admit its existence on to speak of it openly is to skirt the edges of however had developed boldness so she was my dear he repeated not in the least for once she was beautiful dark and splendid with eyes that looked right through you mocking and yet mournful they made a noble couple she and notwithstanding the of age as they stood there together i felt honoured to see them both and if is to have friends with whom we are â though i do not deny the thing hurt me a little at first â i am glad they should be so handsome and fine it seems to me fitting and as if he was in his true sphere at last a silence followed this profession of faith during which mrs s face presented a singular study she stared at her husband in amazement while the comers of her mouth and her large soft cheeks quivered well i should never have expected to hear you talk so she said it seems unlike you somehow almost as though you were your own flesh and blood no no he answered i could never do that i could never be so forgetful of all i owe to my own family and to yours i am under deep obligations to both but it would be to deny that i set a wonderfully high value on regard and have done so ever since we were boys together at school to me has always stood by himself i knowing how superior he was to me in mind and in all else so that it has been my truest the far horizon honour and privilege to be admitted to intimacy with him but the difference between us never came home to me as it did when i saw him in other company last night he is fitted for a higher position than he has ever filled yet â we all used to allow that in old days at the bank â or for any society we can offer him so though i felt in a measure i felt glad for i can grudge him nothing in the way of new friends even though they may be differently placed to ourselves and should come between him and me a little making our intercourse less frequent and easy than in the past from my heart i wish him the very best that is going although it should be rather to myself mrs s cheeks still quivered but the expression of her face was once more not to say obstinate jealousy indeed possessed her for the first time in her whole experience she her husband as an individual as a human independent of herself to contemplate him otherwise than in the relation was a shock to her she felt deserted a on hence jealousy resentment cruel hurt well to be sure what a long story she cried in â tones approaching sarcasm and all about who is no relation too whatever possesses you you aren t a bit like yourself it seems to me this morning everybody s she heaved herself up out of her chair i shall go and try to make it up with she continued it is only christian

owed this pleasing news to louis who had assisted her in her flight from the persecution of her detested had through his influence managed to introduce her under an assumed name as a friend of his own

resignation â lonely indeed yet satisfied to have made good her escape for the time and as she imagined to have saved john from any possibility of annoyance to him through her or by her means she would not consent to have even with her lest any accidental due to her hiding place might be found and followed as soon however as she heard that had actually left england she made haste to return at

free and independent woman to all the county â and if people had about her or were prone to gossip they would soon find out the error of their ways hence the creation of the becoming violet velvet copied from the picture of her in s gallery she had determined to make an effective entrance on the field â to look as pretty and picturesque as she possibly could and to show that she was herself and nobody else bound to no authority save her own in this purely feminine ambition she certainly accomplished her end she was the centre of attraction â au the members of the hunt dispersed round and

evident astonishment as he appeared god s good man gradually to recognise her identity his face always livid grew more deeply sallow of hue and an ugly grin made a of his mouth and eyes she as soon as she recollected him remembered at the same time the curse he had flung at her â a may curse she thought to herself with a superstitious little shudder â and a may curse always begins to work in

her with a strangely tender compassion why did he look so worn and worried had he missed her had her two months and more of absence seemed as long to him as they had to her she wondered i anon she asked herself why she wondered what did it matter to her what he thought or how he passed his days then a sudden rush of colour warmed her cheeks and a light came into her eyes it did matter â there was no getting away from it â it did matter very much what he thought and it had become of importance ta her to know how he passed his days i deep in her heart a secret sweet consciousness lay â a consciousness feminine which told her that she was held in precious estimation by at least one man â and that she had advanced towards her most cherished desire of love so far as to have become dear

window in the church of st best â he would be pleased if that were done â â she was sure he would be pleased â and she had managed during her in to secure some of the loveliest old stained glass from

moments duration then the judge surrendered to the prisoner and with bitterness in his voice told her to take the oath after her fashion sunk at once to her knees and as she laid her hands upon the

her that had broken out of prison twice before of arc was too proud to insist she only said as she rose to go with the guard of arc it is true i have wanted to escape and i do want to escape then she added in a way that would touch the pity of anybody i think it is the right of every prisoner and so she went from the place in the midst of an impressive stillness which made the and more to me the

had the r of a wise good and patriotic magistrate but from the time that he took part against the rights of his country the people s love and respect were turned to scorn and hatred and he never had another hour of peace by ic s chair in order to show what a fierce and dangerous spirit was now aroused among the inhabitants grandfather related a passage from history which we shall call the mob oh

royal the gilded of the glittered in the blaze the of this was ttie well known signal for the of boston to in the street before the tar barrel s of which the was made were half burnt out a great crowd had come together they were chiefly and men together with many young and all those idle people about town who are for any kind of mischief doubtless some school boys were among them while these rough figures stood round the blazing you might hear them speaking bitter words against the high officers of the province governor and other men whom king george delighted to honor were as to the country now and then perhaps an officer of the crown passed along the street by ic s chair wearing the gold hat white wig and embroidered waistcoat which were the fashion of the day but when the people beheld him they set up a wild and angry howl and their faces had an evil aspect which was made more terrible by the flickering blaze of the i should like to throw the traitor right into that blaze perhaps one fierce would say yes and all his brethren too another might reply and the governor and old into the of it and the earl of along with them muttered a third and burn the whole pack of them under king george s no matter if it him some such expressions as these either shouted aloud or muttered under the breath were doubtless heard in king street the mob meanwhile were growing and and seemed ready even to set the town on fire for the sake of burning the king s friends out of house and home and yet angry as they were they sometimes broke into a loud roar of laughter as if mischief and destruction were their sport but we must now leave the for a time and take a peep into the lieutenant governor s splendid mansion it was a large brick house decorated with and stood in garden court street near the north square by ic s while the angry mob in kin street were shouting his name lieutenant sat quietly in grandfather s chair of the evil that was about to fall upon his head his family were in the room with him he had thrown off his embroidered coat and powdered wig and had on a loose flowing gown and purple velvet cap he had likewise laid aside the cares of state and all the thoughts that had wearied and perplexed him throughout the day perhaps in the enjoyment of his home he had forgotten all about the stamp act and scarcely remembered that there was a king across the ocean who had resolved to make of the new possibly too he had forgotten his own ambition and would not have exchanged his situation at that moment to be governor or even a lord the wax candles were now lighted and showed a handsome room well provided with rich furniture on the walls hung the pictures of s ancestors who had been eminent men in their day and were remembered in the history of the country every object served to mark the residence of a rich aristocratic gentleman who held himself high above the common people and could have nothing to fear from them in a corner of the room thrown carelessly upon a chair were the scarlet by ic grandfather s chair robes of the chief justice this high office as well as those of lieutenant governor and judge of was filled by who or what could disturb the domestic quiet of such a great and powerful personage as now sat in grandfather s chair the lieutenant governor s favorite daughter sat by his side she leaned on the of our great chair and looked up affectionately into her er s face rejoicing to perceive that a quiet smile was on his lips but suddenly a shade came across her countenance she seemed to listen attentively as if to catch a distant sound what is the matter my child inquired father do not you hear a tumult in the streets said she the lieutenant governor listened but his ears were than those of his daughter he could hear nothing more terrible than the sound of a summer breeze sighing among the tops of the elm trees no foolish child he replied patting her cheek there is no tumult our boston are satisfied with what mischief they have already done the king s friends need not tremble so resumed his pleasant and peaceful meditations and again forgot that there were any troubles in the world but his family were alarmed and could not help straining their ears by ic s to catch the slightest sound more and more distinctly they heard shouts and then the of many feet while they were listening one of the neighbors rushed breathless room a mob â a terrible mob cried he they have broken into mr s house and into mr s and have made themselves drunk with the ,35

glimmering afar in the afternoon sunshine like an imaginary structure â an air castle by chance descended upon earth and resting there one instant before it vanished as we sometimes see a soap touch on the carpet â a thing of only momentary and no substance destined to be and crushed down by the first cloud shadow that might fall upon that spot even as i looked it disappeared shall i attempt a picture of this of modem ingenuity or what else shall i try to paint everything in london and its vicinity has been depicted innumerable times but never once translated into intelligible images it is an old old never yet told nor to be told while writing these reminiscences i am continually impressed with the of the effort to give any truth to my sketch so that it might produce such pictures in the reader s mind as would cause the original scenes to appear familiar when afterwards beheld nor have other writers often been more successful in representing definite objects to my own mind in truth i believe that the chief delight and advantage of this kind of literature is not for any real information that it supplies to people but for the recollections and the emotions of persons already acquainted with the scenes described thus i found an exquisite pleasure the other day in reading mr s month in england â a fine example of the way in which a refined and cultivated american looks at the old country the things that he naturally seeks there and the modes of feeling and reflection which they excite correct outlines avail little or nothing though truth of colouring may be somewhat more impressions however states of mind produced by interesting and remarkable objects these if and vividly recorded may work a genuine effect and though but the result of what we go farther towards representing the actual scene than any old home direct effort to paint it give the emotion that about it and without able to the spell by which it is summoned up you get something like a of the object in the midst of them from some of the above reflections i draw the comfortable that the longer and better known a thing may be so much the more eligible is it as the subject of a descriptive sketch on a sunday afternoon i passed through a side entrance in the time blackened wall of a place of worship and foimd myself among a congregation assembled in one of the and the immediately portion of the it was a vast old edifice spacious enough the extent bj its roof and by its stone pavement to accommodate the whole of church going london and with a far wider and than any human power of lungs could fill with audible prayer benches were arranged in the on one of which i seated myself and joined as well as i knew how in the sacred business that was going forward but when it came to the sermon the voice of the preacher was and so were his thoughts and both seemed impertinent at such a time and place where he and all of as were bodily included within a sublime act of religion which could be seen above and around us and felt beneath our feet the structure itself was the worship of the devout men of long ago preserved in stone without losing an of its fragrance and it was a kind of strain that they had sung and poured out of the organ in centuries gone by and being so grand and sweet the divine benevolence had willed it to be prolonged for the of i therefore came to the conclusion that in my individual case it would be better and more to let my eyes wander about the edifice than to fasten them and my thoughts on the evidently mortal who was venturing â and felt it no venture at all â to speak here above his breath the interior of westminster abbey for the reader recognized it no doubt the moment we entered is built of rich brown stone and the whole of it â the lofty roof the tall a ur up thb thames clustered pillars and the pointed arches â appears to be in repair at all points where decay has laid its finger the is with iron or otherwise protected and being thus watched over â whether as a place of ancient a noble specimen of art or an object of national interest and pride â it may reasonably be expected to for as many ages as have passed over it already it was sweet to feel its venerable its peace and yet to observe how kindly and even cheerfully it received the sunshine of to day which fell from the great windows into the fretted and arches that laid aside somewhat of their aged gloom to welcome it sunshine always seems friendly to old churches and castles kissing them as it were with a more affectionate though still familiarity than it to of later date a square

delightful region the people cart their hay in baskets carried on their backs women as well as men after waiting about an hour we went on board of the steamer which was a very small affair but as

in any other capacity than that of a servant by watch and wait or and one of tlie boys was very nearly white the other was as black as they were and from the far and the story which they told to mr grant and his happy family will form the substance of this volume the plantation of colonel was situated on one of the numerous which form a complete of water communications in the western part of the parish of in the state of the colonel whose military title was only a courtesy accorded to his distinguished position was a man of immense possessions and of large influence his acres and his were numbered by thousands and he was largely engaged in growing sugar and rice the estate on which he resided went by the name of his mansion was in its dimensions and was furnished in a style of r magnificence by the young the region in was situated was a low country subject to in the season of high water the sugar plantation was on a belt of land not more than a mile in width upon the border of the which contrary to the usual law was higher ground than portions farther from the river the lower lands were used for the culture of rice which our young readers know must be during a part of the year a short distance from the splendid mansion of the was a large village of negro huts where the â people of the estate resided as colonel was a liberal and man the houses of the were far superior to those found upon many of the of the south they were well built neatly and no doubt the who dwelt in them regarded it as a fortunate circumstance that they were the slaves of colonel along the front of the negro hamlet and of the mansion house ran the public highway while in the rear of them and at a distance of nearly by watch and wait or half a mile was the which was generally called

small boats including a light and a four oar race boat in the middle of the stream lay a large sail boat in which the often made long for pleasure for by the of rivers with which the was connected he could explore a vast tract of country and even reach the red river on the north and the gulf of on the south the family that dwelt in the great house as the called the mansion were colonel his wife and two children the himself was a genial pleasant man when nothing by the young i disturbed him but he was quick and impulsive and the homage due to his position from his mrs was an easy indolent woman who would submit to injury rather than endure the effort required to ess it master his older child was a youth of fifteen and was as much like his father as miss a young lady of fourteen was

nothing but england he is the john bull of spiritual europe let him live love him as he was and could not but be pitiable it is no doubt that a samuel johnson must s philosophy by some story from a clergyman of the of should see nothing in the great but s in himself but a man literal rum in but one worthy to be hanged and in the universal long prepared inevitable tendency of european thought but

priests to talk kitchen latin with them about ones â our dear foolish john yet is there a lion s heart within him â pitiable all these things were we say yet nay as basis or as foil to much else that

samuel johnson and yet to love them and fight for them what truth living vigor must such once have had when in the middle of the century there was still led in them for this it is worthy of note that in our little british isle the two grand of europe should have stood embodied under their very highest in two men produced simultaneously among ourselves samuel johnson and david as was observed were children of the same year through life they were spectators of the same of en inhabitants of the same city greater contrast in all things between two great men could not be well bom provided for whole

scotland became european â for which reason too we find his influence spread deeply over all quarters of europe deeply in all speculation french german as well as domestic while johnson s name out of england is hardly any to be met with in spiritual stature they are almost equal both great among the greatest yet how unlike in likeness has the comprehensive eye johnson the keenest for and minute

to many a deep tone of and impetuous graceful power scattered over his fugitive both rather to the general surprise had a certain rugged humor shining through their earnestness the indication indeed that they were earnest men and had subdued their wild world into a kind of temporary home and safe dwelling both were by principle and habit yet johnson with the greater merit for he alone had very much to triumph over farther he alone his into devotion to johnson life was as a prison to be endured with heroic faith to it was little more than a foolish fair show with the foolish and wings of which it was not worth while to quarrel the whole would break up and be at liberty so soon both realized the highest task of manhood that of living like men each died not in his way as one with half false gaiety taking leave of what was itself wholly but a lie johnson as one with awe struck yet resolute and expectant heart taking leave of a reality to enter a reality still higher johnson had the

high just as others are low thus it is in all things whence whence whence whence whence violence what is infinite in man man himself is in exterior things and repulsive which things as lords draw out the whole train of thoughts to potent or cunning warfare so was it with man in his first age dimly known to us as and the record of the flood bears in it that everlasting testimony which god has left

element obeying the same powers the one human nature thus itself we recognise in the two forms into which it perpetually goes out â society worship society instead of being as political would have us think a cunning device a thing of compact on a self interest ascertained by experience is in fact the first natural growth of the human instinct put two men together or two thousand or a million and they will not live one day separate persons they will like so many streams into one centre and seek after that goal of human effort the of that unity the whole whereof each individual is a type in himself so for worship the apprehension of the idea of eternity the sentiment of reverence is rooted in the depth and heart of man s soul all toils of the flesh to root it out are vain but the pure spiritual principle society becomes forthwith the organization of worship the act of superstition this process grows out of fixed law through greater strength or cunning one man will seize and hold more than another each to gain will be self possessions will be enlarged by this of wealth and power the stronger man will come to appropriate what another has to himself ultimately to subdue his neighbors and become their lord their chief their king their tyrant come to worship the idea which is left of god passes of course into kindred and with the spirit thus lessened below the flesh with the soul living an outward life divinity of which man s inward nature is the image will be mixed with these lower elements of humanity to which it has no true correspondence such is fact of history so man in the ages soon after the flood appears in the aspect of to exterior power worship in the aspect of reverence to gods shaped according to the of man s lower nature an arbitrary king represents the one ness of society a bodily god the of the universe absolute society worship rights take the place of individual faith and love if we might refer to the three forms of government into which society shapes itself for the expression of its unity we may say that and aristocracy come nearest to the representation of the ap nearest to the representation of the man or if we look to the different systems of religion although perhaps all institutions of yet it is only christianity which stands forth as a faith and worship of the soul within itself for itself which finds in man the

but that it has a sacred association in our eyes which the other has not in the same way that the literature of the ancient world for so long a time the authors of a modern date does the ancient architecture and dwarf our they dare not invent for themselves for their inventions would seem so beside the great works to which the world would compare them it is cheaper for them and more satisfactory to their customers to borrow a form that all the world has admitted to be beautiful and almost inevitably it by putting it to a wrong use n no one longer doubts that the nature around us is the nature from which drew inspiration and it is the spirit and not the forms of ancient art that make its productions almost divine scarcely in architecture do we see the first faint light of such a dawn yet it depends upon ourselves that ours shall be that glory an intense thirst for the beautiful exists among us â it only requires a direction it is idle for us to complain of the want of models the want of instruction england has wealth of these beyond count yet nowadays no more than we it must come from ourselves from reflection from the study of nature materials rightly employed grow more beautiful with age in pure architecture everything is to be rejected that will grow less beautiful with age for this end it is sufficient that every material should be employed with an eye to its peculiar properties this rule if strictly followed would indeed do away with several materials the of which has rendered their use almost universal but which deserve no place in the severe and simple architecture which should distinguish our churches let it not be our reproach that we are a nation of and plaster and temporary let our joints and beams be made beautiful not hidden â let our wood work show the grain of the wood for ornament not hide it under paint suppose one of our churches were to be left alone for fifty years when we enter how would it be the plaster dropping away

made a far finer building than the actual st the modern certainly attempted more difficult things than the ancient the greek had not to invent the form of his edifice nature and custom had done that

regard to monuments it may be laid down as a rule that all sentimental monuments are bad and all of every sort as a broken column a mother weeping over her child a watchful dog c they strike at first

the simplicity and purity of its form its may be infinitely rich but always entirely sub vol iv no i art and july so that at a distance the effect shall always be of simplicity and repose a simple

40,3880,days when nothing could be done without company the truth was that my heart had gone with william but it would have been too selfish to say a word even to one s self about his day if there is one way above another of getting so close to nature that one simply is a piece of nature following a instinct with perfect forgetfulness and forgetting everything except the dreamy consciousness of pleasant freedom it is to take the course of a shady brook the dark pools and the sunny one on the of sky by a between the trees on either bank the speaking noise of the water the amazing importance of what one is doing and the constant sense of life and beauty make a strange of the quick hours i had a sudden memory of all this and another and another i could not get myself free from fishing and wishing at that moment i heard the unusual sound of wheels and i looked past the thicket of wild roses and straggling to see the white nose and meagre shape of the horse then i saw william sitting in the open wagon with a small expectant smile upon his face i ve got two lines he said i was quite a piece up the road i thought perhaps t was so you d feel like going there was enough excitement for most occasions in hearing william speak three sentences at once words seemed but vain to me at that bright moment i stepped back from the window with a beating heart the beer bottle was not yet in the well and with that and my luncheon and pleasure at the i went out into the happy world the land breeze was blowing and as we turned away i saw a by a flatter of white go past the window as i left the and my morning s work to their neglected fate n one seldom gave way to a cruel impulse to look at an ancient william but one felt as if he were a growing boy i only hope that he felt much the same about me he did not wear the fishing clothes that belonged to his sea going life but a strangely shaped old suit of tea colored linen garments that might have been brought home years ago from or william had a peculiar way of giving silent assent when one spoke but of answering your thoughts as if they reached him better than words i find them very easy he said frankly referring to the clothes father had them in his old sea chest the antique fashion a quaint touch of foreign grace and even imagination about the cut were very pleasing if ever mr had faintly resembled an old beau it was upon that day he now appeared to feel as if everything had been explained between us as if everything were by a quite understood and we drove for some distance without finding it necessary to speak again about anything at last when it must have been a little past nine o clock he stop ed the horse beside a small and nodded when i asked if i should get down from the wagon you can steer about right across the pasture he said looking from under the of his hat with an expectant smile i always leave the team here i helped to the harness and william led the horse away to the bam it was a poor looking little place and a forlorn woman looked at us through the window before she appeared at the door i told her that mr and i came up from the landing to go fishing he keeps a don t he she answered with a funny little laugh to which i was at a loss to find answer when he joined us i could not see that he took notice of her presence in any way except to take an ul of dried salt fish from a in the back of the wagon which had been carefully covered with a piece of old sail we had left a wake of their flavor behind us all the way i wondered what was going to become of the by a rest of them and some fresh which were also disclosed to view but he laid the present gift on the without a word and a few minutes later when i looked back as we crossed the pasture the fish were being carried into the house i could not see any signs of a brook until i came close upon it in the pasture and presently we struck into the low woods of straggling and fir mixed into a of swamp and which stretched away on either hand up and down stream we found an open place in the pasture where some taller trees seemed to have been overlooked rather than spared the sun was bright and hot by this time and i sat down in the shade while william produced his lines and cut and trimmed us each a slender rod i wondered where mrs was spending the morning and if later she would think that had landed and captured me from the iii the brook was giving that live persistent call to a listener that always make it ran with a free swift current even by a here where it crossed an apparently level piece of land i saw two quick chase each other from bank to bank as we solemnly arranged our hooks and i felt that william s glances changed from anxiety to relief when he found that i was used to such gear perhaps he felt that we must stay together if i could not bait my own hook but we parted happily full of a pleasing sense of companionship william had pointed me up the brook but i chose to go down which was only fair because it was his ,40

40,3882,the grammar class sighed like a single pupil and obeyed she was very stern with the grammar class but every one in school had an inner sense that it was a great day in the history of district number four ii the honorable mr found the air very fresh and sweet after the of the school house it had just that same in his boyhood and as he escaped he had a delightful sense of playing or of having an unexpected holiday it was easier to think of himself as a boy and to slip back into boyish thoughts than to bear the familiar burden of his manhood he climbed the tumble down stone wall across the road and went along a narrow a native of path to the spring that up clear and cold under a great red oak how many times he had longed for a drink of that water and now here it was and the thirst of that warm spring day was hard to again and again he stopped to fill the which the school children had made just as his own comrades made theirs years before the oak tree was dying at the top the pine woods beyond had been cut and had grown again since his boyhood and looked much as he remembered them beyond the spring and away from the woods the path led across overgrown pastures to another road perhaps three quarters of a mile away and near this road was the small farm which had been his former home as he walked slowly along he was met again and again by some of his youthful days he had always liked to refer to his early life in new england in his political addresses and had spoken more than once of going to find the cows at nightfall in the autumn evenings and being glad to warm his bare feet in the places where the sleepy beasts had lain before he followed their slow steps homeward through bush and the honorable mr had a touch of true sentiment a native of win by which added much to his really stirring and effective campaign speeches he had often been called the king of the platform in his adopted state he had long ago grown used to saying go to one man and come to another like the ruler of old but all his natural power of and habit of authority disappeared at once as he trod the pasture slopes calling back the remembrance of his childhood here was the place where two lads older than himself had killed a terrible at bay in the angle of a great rock and just beyond was the sunny spot where he had picked a bunch of pink and white under a thicket to give to in morning school she had put them into her desk and let them wilt there but she was pleased when she took them the little teacher s grandmother was a year older than he and had the earliest thought of love in his youthful breast it was almost time to catch the first sight of his from the just ahead he had often seen the light of his mother s lamp as he came home from school on winter but when he reached the the old house was gone and so was a native of the great tree that grew beside it and a pang of disappointment shot through this devout pilgrim s heart he never had doubted that the old farm was somebody s home still and had counted upon the pleasure of spending a night there and sleeping again in that room under the roof where the rain sounded loud and the branches brushed to and fro when the wind blew as if they were the claws of he hurried across the worn out fields long ago turned into sheep pastures where the last year s tall grass and golden rod stood gray and tracing the old walls and fences and astonished to see how small the fields had been the prosperous owner of western farming lands could not help remembering those luxuriant acres and the broad of his western home it was difficult at first to find exactly where the house had stood even the tions had disappeared at last in the long faded grass he discovered the and near by was a little mound where the great tree stump had been the cellar was a mere in the sloping ground it had been filled in by the growing grass and slow processes of summer and winter weather a native of but just at the pilgrim s right were some twigs of an old a sudden brightening of memory brought to mind the love that his mother â dead since his year â had kept f oi this how often she had wished that she had brought it to her new home so much had changed in the world so many had gone into the world of light and here the faithful blooming thing was yet alive there was one slender branch where green were starting and getting ready to flower in the new year the afternoon wore late and still the man lingered he might have laughed at some one else who gave himself up to sad thoughts and found fault with himself with no to plead his cause at the bar of conscience it was an altogether lonely hour he had dreamed all his life in a sentimental self satisfied fashion of this return to it had always appeared to be a grand affair but so far he was himself the only interested spectator at his poor occasion there was even a dismal consciousness that he had been perhaps even a little and silly in the old school house the picture of himself on the war path in a native of s was the only tribute that this longed for day had held but he laughed ,40

40,3884,if there were enough already for every man woman and child in america but knew what he was about brown had thought that were a step too low he was conscious of a shameful wish now and then that he had embarked on any sort of business rather than a patent the pride of the j judges and famous at the bar had more than once in the beginning against such a sordid enterprise but as for john b brown this and of an article that no farmer could do without he felt an increasing pride in his success he had merely made use of a little capital that was lying idle and his own superfluous and energy he believed that his legal affairs had been helped rather than by this side issue of his and he and had fought some amazing fights with the world in the course of their short but successful

brown john b b th ave h city here was a general lived in city and one of the clerks must have given wrong information or else the agent had confused what was told him nobody knew where he lived very

of brown was in reality her own property and that she was unconsciously responsible for such was rushing things this morning he eagerly assured his guest that they had made the pay her own bills after the first six months and had advertised only as fast as they gained the means it was the first application of to farming brown and i had little capital to start with but we knew we had hold of a sure

sir in the time i have consumed in telling you four hills of potatoes are planted as well as if you had done each one separately with your own the average time is only three of a minute a horse soon the trick for the is self acting and stops him in the proper place the only thing that troubled us in the beginning was the complaint of that the horses gave trouble and the hills went all over the field this new improvement makes a field as regular as a board with the that stops the instantly the horse to anticipate and makes his four steps forward and stops of his own accord it is less the two

the downward tendency of old age but is it possible we ask again that the mother whose natural instinct renders her so keenly alive to all these feelings as regards her own child can be insensible to the claims of others â can be induced by her own pride or her own selfishness to under foot the high moral obligation laid upon her to be as a mother to her own household but especially to the young remembering that they will go forth into the world bearing the seal upon their of her maternal care or of her most neglect nor is this all she must remember too that these very youths are to constitute in after life that strong of respectability in whose moral power are the interests of the people and the welfare of the state is it right then â is it just â is it â that during five or seven long years of the lives of such men â years in which the most lasting impressions they ever will receive are made upon their minds â is it right or in any way to be reconciled to english women that for this portion of their lives they should be subjected to a system of moral discipline calculated in almost every way to lower them as future citizens of the world but it is not always thus there are noble and beautiful instances of women who absolutely could not live upon such terms warm hearted patriotic women who cannot sit down to their own tables without a cordial welcome for every one entitled to a place at the same board â who putting aside all personal feeling can even make friends of such associates remembering that to their parents and their country they are in a great measure responsible for the high or low position such men may take in after life yes we are happy in believing there are those who would willingly bear all the annoyance or restraint of such society were it greater than it is rather than be the cause of one young man being drawn out from home to seek enjoyment or down into a lower grade of social fellowship for a freedom and a cordiality which he could not find with her contemptuously as young men will often speak of the influence and the habits of women in general i believe there are few who may not in the early part of their lives be more easily influenced by women than by men â by judicious women i mean for notwithstanding the of which some youths are guilty themselves they appear to be instinctively quick sighted to the of others and especially to those of woman in fact they seem glad to lay hold of any excuse for them and even where they feel the greatest respect will seldom acknowledge it openly or directly but for all this the cautious and well ordered treatment of women tells upon their the wives op england in the end and by a little good natured falling in with their a little forbearance under the of their a little good sense and a great deal of cheerfulness an amiable woman will seldom fail to obtain even without the assumption of any direct authority an extensive influence over the young men with whom she is associated for this reason and because the master of a family with whom it rests to exercise real authority cannot so well and make himself familiar with the young people under his direction the claims of this part of the community are strong upon the wives of england who as they value the comfort of their own sons and estimate with regard to them the advantages of a high moral standard can surely not forget the interests of the stranger s son committed to their care the same observations apply with equal force to of every description excepting only that those who are not bound may be considered as at liberty to find situations more suited to their ideas of comfort but above all others the class of destitute or relatives are most entitled to our consideration and kindness yet such is the weakness of human nature in cases of severe or protracted trial that the good and the happiness of all parties seem to require as little mixing up as possible in the same household of rich and poor relations when the poor have to be provided for by more relatives it is better â far better to do this at a distance or at least not associated as one family though such needful precaution has nothing whatever to do with the kindness which may often be most extended towards them as guests or indeed as members of the same family for a limited period in all such cases there are difficulties to be with on both sides owing to the natural tendency in one party to suspect or imagine and in the other to apprehend or resist one half of these however i am fully persuaded might be by a candid and delicate mode of behavior on the part of the mistress of a house who such relatives as guests her behavior must be delicate in the extreme because she has to do with those whose peculiar situation renders them more than commonly susceptible of pain and it must be candid because in all such cases the habit of leaving things to be understood is the way to produce still the delicacy which would make no difference be felt would fail in its object to do good because as the world considers there is a vast difference between abundant and slender pecuniary means there could be no kindness in persuading those who ,41
41,3986,no other is open it is the supreme importance attached to these cares and anxieties which prevents such a system of management being properly called good in order to maintain general cheerfulness and promote happiness throughout your household it is essential that you cultivate within your own mind a feeling of content ment with your home your servants and your domestic affairs in general remembering that nothing which occurs to you in this department is the result of mere chance but that all your trials as well as your are appointed by a kind providence who knows better than you can know exactly what is ultimately best for you it is consequently no more a from what you ought to be prepared to expect that your servants should sometimes do wrong that your plans should be by folly and or that your house should be old and inconvenient than that the blossoms in your garden should occasionally be or that a shower should fall at the moment you had fixed for going out yet to maintain this desirable cheerfulness through all circumstances is certainly no domestic management easy task unless both health and temper have been carefully attended to before marriage for when the former fails it is but natural that the animal spirits should fail too and defects of temper if long indulged so as to have grown into habit will in the general conduct of domestic affairs be able to a taint of bitterness into the kindest so as effectually to defeat the best intentions how necessary is it therefore for all women to have learned to manage themselves before undertaking the management of a household for the charge is both a serious and a comprehensive one and however inexperienced a wife may be however helpless and unequal to the task she no sooner takes upon herself the duties of a mistress than she becomes in a i great measure responsible for the welfare of every member of the family over which she and not only is this her situation in the ordinary course of things but on all extraordinary occasions she must be at the same post ever on the alert prompt to direct and ready with suited to every emergency that may occur la cases of illness more especially though the more laborious duties of the sick room may with propriety be to others mere can be no excuse for the mistress who does not make it her business to see that proper attention is paid to the directions of the doctor as well as to the of rooms and all those other means of pain or recovery instead of which inexperienced nurses are so apt to substitute notions and of their own but beyond the care of the patient that of the nurse also upon the mistress of the house to see that her wants are properly supplied that a judicious distribution of her tune is made so as to allow of a reasonable portion of rest or if wearied out to take care that her place is supplied so that none may have to complain of hardship or oppression and here we may observe by the way that this kind of care and consideration bestowed upon those who habitually bear the burden of domestic labor one of the strongest bonds which can exist between a mistress and her servants besides her in many instances by a double measure of their gratitude and their if the mistress of the house as is not the case with kind hearted women should take charge of the patient herself it then becomes her duty not to act so entirely from the impulse of feeling as to neglect her own health i mention this because there is a kind of romantic devotion to the duties of the sick room more especially where the sufferer is an object of interest or affection which carries on the young nurse from one day of solicitude to another without refreshment without rest and without exercise in the open air until nature being completely exhausted she herself becomes a source of trouble and an object of anxiety and care by this apparent generosity the kindest intentions are often while the household of such a mistress will necessarily be thrown into alarm and disorder at the very time when it is most important that order and quiet should be maintained throughout to those who please themselves with the idea that such romantic self devotion is the extreme of generosity it may appear a cold kind of reasoning to advocate the importance of self preservation by frequently taking exercise at short intervals in the open air yet i own i am one of those who prefer the kindness which lasts to that which itself in sudden and violent effort and i would therefore strongly urge upon the wife not only to attend to such means of her own usefulness but to see that the nurse employed under her direction does the same nor is it only in such cases as that already described that married women are apt to neglect the best means of maintaining cheerfulness and preserving health two blessings which they above all other persons have the most reason to estimate highly not that i would an idea of any ne the wives op england of the employment of doctors or the use of i believe this can scarcely be charged upon the wives of england as a general fault but i have known some women almost entirely neglect all kinds of exercise in the open air either because they were too busy or it tired them too much or for that most amiable of all reasons because their husbands were absent and they were too dependent to walk alone and thus from the very excess of their affection they were satisfied on a husband s return to be weary and altogether incapable of adding to his enjoyment whatever be â happy man that ,41

was too large or too small or whether it was in alliance with gambling and he knew the means of buildings and the relation of to but he did not know how many there were in the city how they were trained and paid or how complete their apparatus he sang the advantages of of school buildings to homes but he did not know â he did not know that it was worth while to know â â whether the city were properly heated lighted furnished he did not know how the teachers were chosen and though he one of the of is that we pay our teachers that was because he had read the statement in the advocate times

indignation at the criticism of through a report in which the notorious the radical lawyer asserted that to throw boys and young girls into a bull pen crammed with men suffering from delirium and insanity was not the perfect way of them he had the report by growling folks that think a jail ought to be a hotel make me sick if people don t like a jail let em behave and keep out of it besides

43,4198,and times and buildings all facing city hall park sighing for the opportunities that they represented but i did not act something about a book about myself them me especially the the editor of whidi had begun his career in st louis years before with the western papers with which i had been connected all new york papers seemed huge the tasks they represented and much more difficult true a brother of a famous with whom i had worked hi st louis had come east and connected himself with the world and i might have called upon him and out the land he had fortified with a most f record in the west as had i only i did not look upon none as so somehow again a city editor once of st louis was now here city editor of one of the city s great papers the and another man a sunday editor of had become the sunday editor of the press here but these appeared to me to be exceptional cases i these large and in the main rather dull institutions with the eye of one who seeks to take a fortress the pages of all of these papers as i had noticed in the west with cynical and remarks about that region and their voices representing great circulation and wealth gave them weight in my eyes although i knew what i knew about the of newspapers to financial interests their fear of and their shameful of the ordinary man at every point at which he could possibly be betrayed yet still having the power by weight of lies and and make believe to stir him up to his own and destruction i was frightened by this very power which in subsequent years i have come to look upon as the most deadly ar of all in nature the power to and b ay there was p ut these papers an air of assurance and and authority and superiority which and frightened me to work on the sun the herald the how many from how many angles of our national life were constantly and them from the very same or benches in city hall park as the ultimate solution of all their literary commercial social political problems and the thousands of pipe smoking a book about myself who have the sun alone the and i decided that it would be best for me to to and save a little money before i took one of these frowning by storm and i did return but in what a reduced mood after new york and all i liad seen there and in this darkly brooding and indifferent spirit i now resumed my work a sum of money sufficient to sustain me for a period in new york was all that i wished now and in the course of the next four months i did save two and forty dollars enduring which i marvel at even now â breakfast consisting of a and a cup of coffee dinners that cost no more than a quarter sometimes no more than fifteen in the meantime i worked ss before only to greater advantage because i was now more sure of myself my study of and these recent adventures in the great city had so fired my ambition that nothing could have kept me in i lived on so little that i think i must have done myself some physical harm which told against me later in the struggle for existence in new york at this time i had the fortune to discover and and whose volume to his first principles quite blew me to bits hitherto until i had read i had some lingering of trailing about me faith in the existence of christ the of his moral and the brotherhood of man but on reading science and hebrew tradition and science and han and finding both the old and new to be not of revealed truth but mere records of religious experiences and very ones at that and then taking up first principles and discovering that all i deemed substantial â s place in nature his importance in the universe this too too solid earth man s very identity save as an speck of energy or a suspended drawn or blown here and there by larger forces in which he a book about myself moved quite as an â all questioned and dissolved into other and less things i was thrown down in my or non of life up to this time there had been in me a and desire to get on and the feeling tiiat in doing so we did get somewhere now in its place was the definite conviction that one got nowhere that there was no hereafter that one lived and had his being because one had to and that it was of no importance of one s struggles sorrows and joys it could only be said that they were something which for some inexplicable but unimportant reason responded to and resulted from the hope of pleasure and the fear of pain man was a and and a badly and carelessly driven one at that i fear that i cannot make you feel how these things came upon me in the course of a few weeks reading and left me my fears as to the disorder and of life i felt as low and hopeless at times as a beggar of the streets there was of course this other matter of necessity internal to which i had to respond whether i would or no i was daily facing a round of duties which now more than ever all that i had suspected and that these books proved with a gloomy eye i began to watch how the â and their children the mechanical â forces through man and outside him and this under my very eyes seemed since there was no care for them failures the same one ,43

supply end where since all thought to gaze upon the fire none were remaining to help the or the energetic when this last company of fire arrived with their and other for fighting a blaze the flames had gained that there was little to be done wasted half an hour discussing fire protection and then himself of his engagement i must be out of this he said to as they stood gazing upon the flames and the throng i am late as ic is the genial scarcely heard him at all so was he that his own luncheon mattered not at all quietly withdrew then and getting when the old century was new back into boston road and the himself toward the green and s that lady s mansion was to the west of ihe old looking out over lawn and lane to some space of water to be seen in the east river and a boat or two at anchor in the bay as he tapped upon the broad door with its brazen a servant opened to hint bowing profoundly in greeting will master give me his hat and gloves ah master remarked the hostess who now entered smiling i had almost doubted your though you have good reason whose house is it burning count s answered mentioning the french representative to our government i have sent a servant to discover it for me but he has not yet returned it must have fascinated him also we must sit to lunch at once sir as the hostess said this she turned about in her great now but recently like long trousers come into fashion and led the way her hair was done in the curls of the post revolution period three at each side about the ears and a tall that was almost a curl in itself with stately grace she led the way to the dining chamber and bowed him to his place a daughter and a friend entered almost at the same moment with them through another door at the head of the long table there were already standing the two black table servants of this dignified household splendid imported trained in virginia my lady s table was a gleam with much of the richest plate and old holland china in o when the old century was new the city an immense silver the and at every corner were separate gold sticks making a splendid show i have the greatest terror of fire anywhere in our city began the hostess even as young was bowing we have so little protection i have urged upon our the necessity of providing something better than we have â a water tower or something of the sort but so far nothing has come of it you were at the fire master inquired the handsome i came that way with several friends from the collect he answered why the collect asked the hostess who was now seated with the two towering above her there is a man there who has a boat which is to go without sail as i understand it providing his idea is correct it is to go by steam i believe only he did not succeed in making it se do to day at least not while i was there it may have gone though i could not wait to see oh exclaimed putting up a pair of pretty hands and really is it a boat that will travel so i cannot for that returned the youth gravely it was not going when we visited it the fire and my engagement took the entire audience of the away and he smiled i shall have no faith in any such trap as that until i see it observed madame fancy being on the water and no sail to you mercy i it will be some time before men will ven when the old century was new ture afar on any such craft returned the youth but it is a bit curious dangerous i should say suggested mistress no said not that i think my father has often told me that master predicted to him that men should harness the lightning before many years that is

44,4303,do there is one thing my er â said the professor solemnly after dinner when the neat had left them at one thing on which i think it my duty to caution you if you are to justify the confidence we have shown in your engagement to you must this of yours to needless extravagance papa cried what could have made you think extravagant said i shouldn t have called myself particularly so nobody ever does call himself particularly extravagant retorted the professor but i observed at st that you habitually gave fifty as a when or even a penny would have been handsome and no one with any regard for the value of money would have given a guinea for a worthless brass vessel on the bare chance that it might contain which as any one could have foreseen it did not but it s not a bad sort of bottle sir pleaded if you remember you said yourself the shape was unusual why shouldn t it be worth all the money and more to a perhaps said the professor with his which you are no i by ic can only call it a senseless and waste of money well the truth is said i bought it with some idea that it might interest then you were mistaken sir it does not interest me why should i be interested in a metal jar which for anything that appears to the contrary may have been cast the other day at but there is something said a seal or inscription of some sort engraved on the cap didn t i mention it you said nothing about an inscription before replied the professor with rather more interest what is the character â i really couldn t say â it s almost rubbed out â queer little marks something like birds that sounds like said the professor which would seem to point to a origin and as i am acquainted with no oriental brass earlier than the ninth century of our era i should regard your description as a distinctly unlikely however i should certainly like to have an opportunity of examining the bottle for myself some day whenever you please professor when can you come why i m so much occupied all day that i can t say for certain when i can get up to your f by ic the brass bottle my own days will be fairly full now said and the thing s not at the but in my rooms at square why shouldn t you all come and dine quietly there some evening next week and then you could examine the inscription comfortably afterwards you know professor and find out what it really is do say you will he was eager to have the privilege of entertaining in his own rooms for the first time no no said the professor i see no reason why you should be troubled with the entire family i may drop in alone some evening and take the luck of the pot sir thank you papa put in but i should like to come too please and hear what you think of s bottle and i m dying to see his rooms i believe they re fearfully luxurious i trust observed her father that they are far indeed from answering that description if they did i should consider it a most unsatisfactory indication of s character there s nothing magnificent about them i assure you said though it s true i ve had them done up and all that sort of thing at my own expense â but quite simply i couldn t afford to spend much on them but do come and see them i must have a little dinner to my good it will be so jolly if you ll all three come by if we do come the professor it must be on the distinct understanding that you don t provide an elaborate banquet plain simple wholesome food well cooked such as we have had this evening is all that is necessary more would be my dear protested in distress at this somewhat speech surely you can leave all that to my dear understands that in speaking as i did i was simply treating him as a member of my family here made a private little no young man who marrying should allow himself to into extravagance on the strength of prospects which for all he can tell said the professor may prove on the contrary if his affection is sincere he will as little expense as possible put by every penny he can save rather than subject the girl he to love to the ordeal of a long engagement in other words the truest lover is the best i quite understand sir said good it would be foolish of me to attempt any ambitious form of entertainment â especially as my landlady though an excellent plain cook is not exactly a so you can come to my modest board without before he left a date for the dinner was fixed for an evening towards the end of the next week by ic the brass bottle and walked home treading on air rather than hard stones and striking the stars with his uplifted head the next day he went down to and made the acquaintance of the whole family who were all enthusiastic about the proposed country house the site was everything that the most could desire and he came back to town the same evening having spent a pleasant day and learnt enough of his s and â what was even more important â those of his s wife and daughters to enable him to begin work upon the sketch plans the next morning he had not been long in his rooms at square and was still agreeably engaged in recalling the and ready appreciation with which the had received his suggestions and rough sketches their compliments and absolute ,44

45,4406,the front door was closed and as if to express still more fully the sealed and state of the establishment a sand bag was placed at the bottom to keep out the snow drift the wind setting in directly from that quarter the landlord entering his own parlor walked a of noble to the large fire which it was absolutely necessary to keep up for his comfort no such blaze burning in the coffee room or elsewhere and after giving it a stir returned to a table in the whereon lay the visitors book â now closed and pushed back against the wall he carelessly opened it not a name had been entered there since the th of the previous november and that was only the name of a man who had arrived on a who indeed had not been asked to enter at all while he was engaged thus the evening grew darker but before it was yet too dark to distinguish objects upon the road winding round the back of the cliffs the landlord perceived a black spot on the distant white which speedily enlarged itself and drew near the were that this vehicle â for a vehicle of some sort it seemed to be â would pass by and pursue its way to the nearest railway town as others had done but contrary to the landlord s expectation as he stood it through the yet windows the solitary object on reaching the comer turned into the hotel front and drove up to the door it was a conveyance particularly to such a season and weather being nothing more substantial than an open basket carriage drawn by a single horse within sat two persons of different sexes as could soon be discerned in spite of their muffled attire the man held the reins and the lady had got some shelter from the storm the honorable by clinging close to his side the landlord rang the s bell to attract the attention of the stable man for the approach of the visitors had been to by the snow and when the had come to the horse s head the gentleman and lady alighted the landlord meeting them in the hall the male stranger was a foreign looking individual of about eight and twenty he was close shaven excepting a his features being good and even handsome the lady who stood timidly behind him seemed to be much younger â possibly not more than eighteen though it was difficult to judge either of her age or appearance in her present the gentleman expressed his wish to stay till the morning explaining somewhat considering that the house was an inn that they had been unexpectedly on their drive such a welcome being given them as can give in dull times the latter ordered fires in the drawing and coffee rooms and went ho the boy in the yard who soon himself up dragged his jacket from its box polished the buttons with his sleeve and appeared civilized in the hall the lady was shown into a room where she could take off her snow garments which she sent down to be dried her companion meanwhile putting a couple of sovereigns on the table as if anxious to make everything smooth and comfortable at starting and request a group of ing that a private sitting room might be got ready the landlord assured him that the best up stairs parlor â usually public â should be kept private this evening and sent the maid to light the candles dinner was prepared for them and at the gentleman s desire served in the same apartment where the young lady having joined him they were left to the rest and refreshment they seemed to need that something was peculiar in the relations of the pair had more than once struck the landlord though wherein that peculiarity lay it was hard to decide but that his guest was one who paid his way readily had been proved by his conduct and conjectures he turned to practical about nine o clock he re entered the hall and everything being done for the day again walked up and down occasionally gazing through the glass door at the prospect without to ascertain how the weather was contrary to snow had ceased falling and with the rising of the moon the sky had partially cleared light of cloud drifting across the silvery there was every sign that a frost was going to set in later on for these reasons the distant rising road was even more distinct now between its high banks than it had been in the declining daylight not a track or broke the virgin surface of the white mantle that lay along it all marks left by the lately arrived thb having been speedily by the falling at the time and now the landlord beheld by the light of the moon a sight very similar to that he had seen by the light of day again a black spot was advancing down the road that the coast he was in a moment or two enabled to perceive that the present vehicle moved onward at a more headlong pace than the little carriage which had preceded it next that it was a drawn by two powerful horses next that this carriage like the former one was bound for the hotel door this desirable feature of resemblance caused the landlord to once more withdraw the sand bag and advance into the porch an old gentleman was the first to alight he was

46,4511,come to be known as an advanced of action to this bold was due much of his power he was not afraid of the men said and so they established him in his seat as their leader to his presence was due a goodly share of the shadow that had been gathering over the s part of the section of the town which i have noted thus the meeting on the evening i speak of was largely attended for an hour before the time set for it the large hall in the second story of a big building was crowded and many who could not get in were the and the street outside a of strong tobacco pervaded the air and men with sullen brows talked in broken now and then by a discussion in some group in which possibly some other than tobacco played a part and marvel had both been trying to the strike and had i heard made some impression among the people marvel had worked hard all day miss in her friendly efforts and by the walking had been arguing on rational grounds against a strike at the b of winter i had been talking over matters with some of my mill friends who had invited me to go with them so i attended the meeting i had been struck for some time with the change that had been going on in the s districts as wretched as they had been before they were now infinitely more so the meeting b an as the meetings of such bodies usually b in with considerable discussion and appearance of deliberation there was manifest much discontent and also much opposition to taking any steps that would lead to a final breach a number of men boldly stood forth to declare for the half than no bread theory and against much they stood their ground the question of a resolution of thanks for miss s baskets aroused a little opposition but the majority were for it and many pleasant things were said about her and her father as well hb liberal policy being strongly contrasted with the policy of the other roads then there appeared the real leader of the occasion to hear whom the meeting had been called and within ten minutes he had everything his own way he was greeted with cheers as he entered and he shouldered his way to the front with a grim look on his face that had often prepared the way for him he was undoubtedly a man of power physical and mental flinging off his heavy overcoat he scarcely waited for the brief introduction undertaken by the of by john marvel assistant the occasion and refusing to wait for the cheers to he plunged at once into the midst of his subject why am i here because like you i am a working man he stretched out his long arm and swept it in a half circle and they cheered his gesture and voice and violent action though had they considered as they might well have done he had not hit a with hb hands in a number of years unless indeed a which had begun to go the was true that he had once at least performed work for the government in an institution where the labor was not wholly voluntary then came a catalogue of their and wrongs presented with much force and marked dramatic ability and on the heels of it a against all and and especially against their employer whom he pictured as their arch enemy and the chief and final act of whose he declared to be his attempt to bribe them with baskets of rotten fowls who was thb man he would tell them he held in hb hand a paper whidi pictured him in his true character here he opened a journal and read from the article i had written for â the infamous of the editor which changed the whole thb was the man with whom they had to deal â a man who flung scraps from his table for children to over with dogs there was but one way to meet such insolence he declared to fling them back in his face and make him understand that they didn t want from him but justice not rotten fowls by the walking but their own hard earned money and now he cried i put the motion to send every basket back with this message and to demand an increase of twenty five per cent pay forthwith thus we shall show them and all the world that we are independent american workmen earning our own bread and asking no man s meat let all who favor this rise and the sit still it was so quickly and done that a large part of the assembly were on their feet in a second indeed many of them were already standing and the protest of the was lost in the wild storm of applause over on the far side i saw little shouting and in vehement protest but as i caught sight of him a dozen men piled on him and pulled him down him into silence the man s power and boldness had accomplished what his reasoning could never have effected the shouts that went up showed how completely he had won i was thrown into a sort of but his next words recalled me it was necessary he went on that he should still maintain his old position his heart every moment but he would sacrifice himself for them and if need were he would die with them and when this time came he would lead them through flaming streets and over broken to the universal community of everything he drew a picture of the that was to follow which surpassed everything i had ever believed possible when he sat down his audience was a mob of insensible to the folly of the step i ,46

the deck had not been noticed by the crew who were all occupied hy their own danger the was driven along with inconceivable rapidity she had to weather a long on the eastern shore round which the river turned and which completely shut her from s view it was on a point on the western that he landed and up the rocks he threw himself faint and exhausted at the foot of a tree by degrees the thunder gust passed over the clouds rolled away to the east where they lay piled in masses tinted with the last rosy rays of the sun the distant play of the lightning might be still seen about their dark and now and then might be heard the faint muttering of the thunder rose and sought about to see if any path led from the shore but all was savage and the rocks were piled upon each other great trunks of trees lay shattered about as they had been blown down by the strong winds which draw through these mountains or had fallen through age the rocks too were with wild vines and which completely themselves together and opposed a barrier to all every movement that he made shook down a shower from the dripping foliage he attempted to scale one of these almost perpendicular heights but though strong and he found it an undertaking often he was supported merely by crumbling of the rock and sometimes he clung to roots and branches of trees and hung almost suspended in the air the wood pigeon came his whistling flight by him and the eagle screamed from the brow of the impending as he was thus he was on the point of seizing hold of a to aid his ascent when something among the leaves and he saw a snake quivering along like lightning almost from under his hand it itself up immediately in an attitude of defiance with head jaws and quickly tongue that played like a little flame about its mouth s heart turned faint within him and he had well nigh let go his hold and tumbled down the precipice the serpent stood on the but for an instant it was an instinctive movement of defence and finding there was no attack it glided away into a of the rock s eye followed it with fearful intensity and he saw at a glance that he was in the vicinity of a nest of that lay knotted and and hissing in the chasm he hastened with all speed to escape from so frightful a neighbourhood his imagination was of this new horror he saw an in every curling vine and heard the tail of a rattle snake in every dry leaf that at length he succeeded in to the summit of a precipice but it was covered by a dense forest wherever he could gain a look out between the trees he saw that the coast rose in heights and cliffs one rising beyond another until huge mountains the whole there were no signs of cultivation nor any smoke curling amongst the trees to indicate a human residence every thing was wild and solitary as he was standing on the edge of a precipice that overlooked a deep fringed with trees his feet detached a great fragment of rock it fell crashing its way through the tree tops down into the chasm a loud or rather yell issued from the bottom of the the moment after there was the report of a gun and a ball came whistling over his head cutting the twigs and leaves and burying itself deep in the bark of a chestnut tree did not wait for a second shot but made a retreat fearing every moment to hear the enemy in pursuit he succeeded however in returning to the shore and determined to penetrate into a country so beset with savage perils he sat himself down dripping â on a wet stone what was to be done where was he to shelter himself the hour of repose was approaching the birds were seeking their nests the bat began to about in the twilight and the night hawk soaring high in heaven seemed to be calling out the stars night gradually closed in and wrapped every thing in gloom and though it was the latter part of summer yet the breeze stealing along the river and among these dripping forests was chilly and penetrating especially to a man as he sat drooping and in this condition he perceived a light gleaming through the trees near the shore where the winding of the river made a deep bay it cheered him with the hopes that here might be some human habitation where he might get

respected almost at a first glance and although he possessed courage both moral and physical in a high degree one observation more is essential to the completion of his outline he looked upon all accounts of and supernatural appearances with the most profound contempt but he lived to change his opinions such a person in consequence of his integrity and intelligence is always useful at as a in fact ever since the year of his age he had served in that capacity with the reputation of being a shrewd honest and humane man who permitted nothing to sway him from the direct line of his in a word
